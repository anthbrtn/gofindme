Quiggin Report` ,"East York, ON",Other,"Operation: Kill Switch asks why a federally registered taxpayer subsidized charitable organization, with alleged links to extremism, still has charitable status?   Why does the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and many of his caucus members have such strong ties to these types of organizations? Military veteran and intelligence expert, Tom Quiggin, has been sharing technical intelligence analysis on this issue and is now targeted in a frivolous multi-million-dollar lawfare lawsuit to try to silence him. Should taxpayer-funded charities be allowed to target our military veterans with your money? -> Help us protect this military veteran who continues to fight to keep our society (and us) safe from growing extremism.-> Help us expose these organizations and their members for their alleged nefarious connections to extremism by supporting our campaign now.Speak up and act while you still can. Your donations and support will help us fight back.BACKGROUNDLast year, Tom Quiggin, an ex-military intelligence and counter-terrorism expert launched a podcast to share his 30 years of experience in intelligence gathering and analysis on the current threats our society is facing.Tom Quiggin is a court qualified expert on terrorism (criminal court and Federal Court) and “intelligence collection and evidence” (Federal Court). Tom has testified on multiple occasions to Senate and the House of Commons Committees as well as a Royal Commission (Air India Inquiry 2007). He has also provided testimony to the Special Senate Committee on Anti-terrorism (2010).  A former Senior Fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he has 30 plus years of practical intelligence experience in a variety of positions including the: - Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Bank of Canada, - Canadian Armed Forces- United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia- Citizenship and Immigration Canada (War Crimes) - International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (The Hague)- Privy Council Office of Canada. - Arms control inspector for the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the Vienna Document. For the past several years Tom Quiggin has been researching the growth of extremism in western nations engaged in a well financed campaign of entryism, fueled by numerous front groups tracing back to the The Muslim Brotherhood Islamist Terrorist network.  Due to the vast amounts of financial support from foreign actors, mainstream media often refuses to report on these and related topics. They fear reprisal or being targeted by lawfare / harassment lawsuits, designed exclusively to cause ongoing financial damages through exorbitant legal fees charged to any defendant. This is the tactic being used now against Tom Quiggin, Raheel Raza of Muslims Facing Tomorrow, and Tahir Gora (co-authors of the book Submission) for filing an official complaint to Canada’s federal police and intelligence agency, The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Canadian Security and Intelligence Agency (CSIS) is also believe to be surveilling similar operations.  In 2015 a federally registered organization was identified as a Muslim Brotherhood front group in Senate Testimony in Canada. Since then, Tom Quiggin has been exposing the facts of its relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas both listed terrorist organizations by a variety of foreign military and  intelligence agencies. This organization has now launched a retaliatory multi-million dollar lawfare harassment lawsuit accusing Tom Quiggin and six other entities of allegedly running a “campaign of defamation”. Although many of the documents sighted in the RCMP complaint are Government of Canada sources, the organization has decided that these are irrelevant and is desperately trying to keep Tom Quiggin’s body of work on this topic hidden from public consumption.   This is an aggressive scare tactic aiming to force us to abandon our platforms, to censor documented facts and obfuscate the responsibility of the actors involved.We will not back down. They have made this a public legal battle where our irrefutable evidence will expose them to public scrutiny. But we desperately need your support. Operation: Kill Switch is how we do this. We need your help to bring the evidence to trial and take this organization down, so if you support this cause, please help us by contributing to the campaign today.OPERATION: KILL SWITCH The federally registered charity, Islamic Relief Canada, is politically connected to the Liberal Party of Canada, influential in terms of policy and directly linked to Islamic Relief Worldwide. (Islamic Relief Worldwide has been listed as a terrorist funding operation by The United Arab Emirates). Much of our evidence has been provided by government documents and or Islamic Relief Canada’s own documentation, but winning the case and pushing back at this  organizations aggressive bullying tactic, cannot be taken lightly. They have considerable financial resources and support from numerous other powerful organizations. In addition, since the Trudeau government was elected, the organisation in question, are now receiving funding directly from the government of Canada to combat “islamophobia”. This will become relevant at a later date. To document and prove the connections, and to follow the money trail, requires a lot of preparation, an organized and strategic response, and financial resources. This is Operation: Kill Switch - A coordinated effort to defend our rights and freedoms, to question and debate the activities of this group and others like it, and deter them from accessing taxpayer money to finance extremist activities abroad.If you believe in this cause as much as we do, please help us and donate to the campaign now.PREPARATION HAS BEGUNThe victims being targeted in this harassment suit have sought legal council to assess the campaign against them.  Based on initial consultations and research, we have started taking action to prepare our response and a statement of defence - a public document highlighting much of our evidence, which has now been filed with the superior court.  Operation Kill Switch is already very much underway:- A team of researchers with expertise in analysis, from various countries and backgrounds, is collecting more and more evidence- Tom Quiggin is working with other specialists in his network, to build on the evidence in the initial statement of defence and ensure the are filed, and on the public record.- Council retained by Tom Quiggin are experienced in the field of defamation and lawfare suits targeting individuals(What is lawfare? Lawfare is a form of war consisting of the use of the legal system against an enemy, such as by damaging or delegitimizing them, tying up their time or winning a public relations victory. The term is a portmanteau of the words law and warfare.  Lawfare is the use or misuse of the law to silence critics or drive them into submission rather than using other means such as civil discourse or discussion. Islamist groups in North America regularly use well-funded lawfare cases to silence or frighten those who expose their extremist beliefs.)- Community groups and leaders have been contacted to address questions about nefarious entities working within the plaintiff organization, allegedly making statements that could be considered hate speech.  For example, Fathima Bahatta executive member of Islamic Relief has been recorded making statements like “the Jews are the enemies of Islam” and long live the antifada [Holly war against Jews.] We have requested an investigation into hate speech comments demanding her resignation.- Operation Kill Switch will also lead a parallel investigation and inquiry asking how an organization with potentially questionable and/or indirect ties to extremism could still be a federally registered charity under Canadian and international law.- Aid concerned advocacy groups working to fight against extremism, hate speech and groups fighting anti-semitism, to highlight such egregious views and demand the immediate resignation of these individuals. WHO IS INVOLVED?The following people are targeted in the proceedings:TOM QUIGGIN Tom Quiggin is a federal and criminal court-qualified terrorism expert whose expertise on the “the reliability of intelligence as evidence” has been recognized by the Federal and Criminal Court of Canada, where his testimony has been entered as evidence on multiple occasions. Quiggin has conducted ground-breaking work to expose facts that are extremely important not only to Canadians but to the international community, as we deal with a global Islamist insurgency which few people are brave enough to address in public forums for fear of targeting by extremists aligned with the islamist cause. This body of evidence is opening avenues for major discussion and debate desperately needed in our society consumed by political correctness, politicking, and the shameful rise of the muzzling of freedom of speech under the banner of Islamophobia. There are opinions and there are facts; Quiggin does not engage in uninformed speculation. There is at least one group, however, attempting to use a tactic called libel chill, using our very own legal system against us, to silence voices like Tom Quiggin purporting that he has used opinion to run a “campaign of defamation”. Quiggin’s expertise has not gone unnoticed and throughout his career, he has been called upon by numerous government entities and specialist organizations to offer his expert advice to their leaders. Today Tom hosts his own podcast to share his intelligence insight with a wider audience, and has a regular spot on National Post Radio and Sirius XM, in his weekly talk with Anthony Fury, host of Canada Talks (channel 167).  Tom is also a frequent guest on syndicated radio programs such as The Roy Green Show with veteran journalist Roy Green, Charles Adler Tonight, Global News Radio with Award Winning Journalist Alex Pierson, Former political leader turned radio journalist Danielle Smith, and numerous alternative media sources, YouTube Channels, podcasts and other forums. RAHEEL RAZARaheel Raza is a member of the Clarion Project Advisory Board and President of the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow. She is an award-winning journalist, author, public speaker, media consultant, anti-racism activist, and interfaith discussion leader. She is the author of, Their Jihad, Not My Jihad: A Muslim Canadian Woman Speaks Out.A constant presence on television, she has appeared as a regular panellist on Jane Hawtin Live, Michael Coren, Ben Mergui Live, Vision, CBC, CTV, City TV, TVO, Faith Journal and Behind the Line on CTS, OMNI as well as on CBC and CFRB radio. In a presentation to Members of Parliament and international diplomats at the House of Commons in Canada, Raza received a standing ovation for her speech called, “Celebrating our Differences.”Raheel has received many awards for her work building bridges of understanding, including the City of Toronto’s Constance Hamilton award for working towards the equitable treatment of women. She also received the Senate of Canada 150 medal in honour of her advocacy. Senator Frum, speaking at the ceremony, cited Raza’s commitment to liberty and equity and thanked her for “relentless advocacy for human rights, particularly the rights of vulnerable girls and women living under Sharia law”.In June 2006, Raheel was invited to meet Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada following which she also had the honour to meet with Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada. Yet, in subsequent years, Canadian leaders have been less honouring of her accomplishments. While politicians are glad to pose for photo ops with more radical voices, Raza said, “a Muslim woman who has been warning about the dangers of radicalization encroaching on the corridors of every institution in this country is kept away like a pariah.”TAHIR GORAGora is a prominent novelist, poet, journalist, editor, translator and publisher with over 30 years of experience in the industry. Recognized as a bold social activist who has initiated many interfaith and pluralistic streams to bring the Muslim community of Canada together to support progressive ideas and actions.He is a strong proponent of freedom of speech and has developed various initiatives to bring about the much-needed changes in the representational and communal aspects of the Canadian Muslim Community. Gora was active in several literary, cultural and political organizations in Pakistan and was a noted critic of religious intolerance in that country. He is a columnist for the Huffington Post, founder of ‘Canadian Thinkers’ Forum’, ‘Progressive Muslims Institute Canada’ and ‘Muslim Committee Against Antisemitism. He is also a recipient of the Queen Diamond Jubilee Medal for his services in Canada.HELP US FIGHT BACKThe suppression of speech and “m103”, the so-called Islamophobia motion, have already gone too far. We must prevent groups with Islamist ideologies and aspirations antithetical to westphalian liberal democratic values from spreading intolerance into our political systems. Extremist groups or those indirectly supporting extremist activities must be cut off from access to taxpayer funding.Please support Operation: Kill Switch to help put a full-stop on political Islamist entryism.

Allen Toma ,"Thornhill, ON",Non-Profits & Charities,"Heart in Hand: Ramsn's Wish... If you are reading this then it means that you know me, Allen Toma, either personally or through a friend, then you'll know.... or you can easily find out that I've lived my life by one important statement:   ""It is more fulfilling to give then to receive"". However even for myself it is not always easy to give because there are so many out there that take advantage of people’s genuine good will or dilute the intentions of good will. However, I believe that in all our hearts, all of us crave the need to pick each other up when we need a hand, when we see someone down and out, if you search your soul deep enough there will be a voice urging you to extend your hand.... ""Our souls crave it, our heart begs us do it, our hands are wide open and our minds make sense of it but fear stops us.... "" Let me help you eliminate the fear to place your heart in your hands and help the way your soul craves it: I want to tell you a story of a courageous, inspiring selfless, brave man named Ramsn Al Bazi. Ramsn is a Canadian Citizen of Chaldean Iraqi decent, he immigrated to Canada in 2009 and he lived in Toronto for 5 years and 5 months and is an active contributing volunteer to the Good Shepard Chaldean Catholic Church in Toronto, Ontario. Like many immigrants lucky enough to have the opportunity to find his way to this country, his first instincts were to rescue his family left behind in Iraq from the turmoil of years of war, and persecution of faith.   As the story goes and as many immigrants new to this country soon realize the process of bringing loved ones to Canada from war torn countries like Iraq is an arduous and bureaucratic process, but with his heart in his hands Ramsn was sucessfully reunited with his family in Woodbridge, Ontario in 2015. But Ramsn's story doesn't stop there. In 2015 Ramsn decided to leave everything he fought so hard to to gain in Canada, including his family, in order to move back to Iraq. The stories and pictures that funneled in of the thousands and thousands of displaced families, elderly grandparents, children mentally and physically challenged became too much for Ramsn to bear.  If you ever have the opportunity to speak to Ramsn you will hear a voice of love, compassion and determination, but his voice quickly weakens when you ask him about the children that have had to endure the pain that no child should ever have to be exposed to.  The sheer pain of what he sees now in front of him everyday pulls at his heart, and brings a grown man to uncontrollable tears.... Ahead of his own safety and well being, Ramsn took it upon himself to start his own solitary mission to help in Iraq. “....after praying to God, on December 29th I left Canada to Iraq to help and protect my beautiful people and always knew God was with me. I loved Canada because I’m a citizen of Canada and part of the Canadian family, as I love Iraq because it is my everything in life...” - Ramsn Al Bazi His mission was to help the same people he shared his life with when he was still in Iraq; People he broke bread with, People who attended church with him on Sundays,People he waved to in passing, People he celebrated with in the community, People he held the door open for at work,  People he sent holiday cards and congratulations to,People he bought gifts for,  Children he watched innocently play in the streets from a more simple and safe time.....  The exact same people you and I cross paths with every single day here in our own lives....   The difference is, these people that Ramsn has volunteered himself selflessly to help, have been forced out of the houses they once called home.... their churches torn down, their faith broken,  No more Christmas, No more birthdays, No more children playing and feeling safe, No doctors, No money, No help..... Just loneliness and desperation... Just take a second to let that sink in....imagine the life you live, the things you get to enjoy, the safety you feel, the happiness you are blessed with, then imagine all of it being taken away without a choice, in an instant..... from your neighbor, from your friends, from your family, and from your very own children. But this isn't a story of just sadness, it is a story of triumph over adversity, a story of compassion, a story of selflessness, a story of success, a story of victory against all odds!!..... Because of the courageous efforts of Ramsn he was able to raise enough support to buy some of these desperate children, basic necessities like wheel chairs so they can move around their refugee camps like everyone else, instead of laying on the floors paralyzed by their condition, unable to move. Here are some pictures that tell stories of these beautiful children that have been touched by Ramsn’s compassion: Soleen: Girl (green pants and white shirt) Condition: Brain paralysisEmad -  Boy (yellow shirt) Condition: QuadriplegicRenas - Boy (holding the walker wearing purple)Condition: Broken Back requires operationYousef - Boy (wearing brown holding toy animal) Both his parents were taken Dalen - Girl (wearing blue and white) Condition: Rare disease of the eye, requires operation costing more than $5000 or she may loose her sight.We were able to help these children, with just some community faith here in Toronto, some local friends getting together to donate whatever was comfortable for them. But just imagine what we can do for these families and children with just a little more faith to put your heart in your hands. Just a little more faith that your each and every dollar is going directly into the hands of these people in the form of heath care, food, and basic necessities that every human being today should have the right to have. No big infrastructure, no big charity, no waste.....every single dollar will change lives. If you have taken the time to read this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your time.If you find it in yourself to donate I hope that you can feel the joy and fulfillment of knowing that you made a difference.If you are still unsure, there is no pressure... but all I ask is that you search your soul for that voice that urges you to be the one that makes a difference. “...... If it is God’s will I will never give up, because I have faith there are still nice people who have their hearts filled with Gods love”.... - Ramsn Al Bazi Check back here for updates on Ramsn's mission in the coming months to see how your support is helping, and please pass this along, if you do anything at all please pass this along.....","January 2, 2016","$1,970","$10,000 "
Terry Christenson ,"Carling, ON",Volunteer & Service,"PLEASE HELP 71-YEAR-OLD ""PROTESTING GRANDPA"" TERRY CHRISTENSON WITH HIS LEGAL EXPENSES! Terry was arrested July 10 while attempting his third protest against the Trans Mountain Pipeline since 2018.  As of July 15, Terry has been in jail for 5 days, after refusing bail and denying legal representation on stated moral and ethical grounds. His next plea hearing is on July 22 in BC Superior Court in Vancouver. --Terry's bio:My name is Terry Christenson. I’m a 71 year old musician/climber/activist who has been a member of Greenpeace since 2006.In 2013 I was one of the first Arctic 30 to take action in Russian territory (Prirazlomnaya platform). In April 2018 I decided to act alone to take action against Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline in Burnaby B.C. I climbed the largest cottonwood within their boundary fence and defied a superior court injunction along with many others that day including Green Party leader Elizabeth May and Greenpeace elder Rex Weyler.As a result of this action I spent the night in Deer Lake RCMP detachment. Those police officers I encountered were absolutely first class people. Being a rope access person I’ve helped train special forces so it does not impress me when I hear overzealous young activists treat them like the enemy.  My brother Ken (extremophilechoice.com) and I have been working on a documentary about indigenous civil rights in the 21st century here in Canada. On March 11, I began my current trip hitch hiking west, and spent 2 weeks in Thunder Bay interviewing various people regarding - ‘the effects of white priviledge on all our lives’, and ‘what would indigenous culture suggest as a possible solution for climate change’.I then hitched two rides to Winnipeg, and eventually took a ViaRail to Vancouver in hopes of taking action against KM Canada before I was supposed to pay a $2000 fine on the 15th of April. The Alberta election dominated the media over that period so I’ve been keeping a low profile, training and preparing for today, April 29th.Now that I’m finally on target I’m asking for your help in paying off my expenses. As of today I’ve made four round trips from Ontario to British Columbia for court and research. I have a semi pro bono lawyer who was an activist in her youth and believes in what we are doing. This time I’ll be pleading not guilty so by the time I get out of jail and fly home I’ll have spent $20,000 on my cards in the last 14 months.This is a citizens action, me, a senior citizen. However, as always I encourage you to support organizations like STAND.earth, Greenpeace Canada and the Suzuki Foundation. Time’s ticking and all these people are working hard for our children and their children’s future. Thanks for your support.Cheers. t","April 29, 2019","$5,650","$5,000 "
Kira Galipeau ,"Etobicoke, ON","Sports, Teams & Clubs","Hello Everyone! I wanted to start this off by saying thanks for taking time out of your day to read this! It’s  kind of a long story, approximately 6 years long. But I promise I will shorten it as much as I possibly can. You might want to get comfortable though.I’m going to jump right into it and introduce the star of the show, my little brother, also known as Erik Galipeau. Erik is your average 18 year old boy... Except he lawn bowls. Yes... lawn bowls!! That was my first reaction as well.This story began when Erik was 12 years old. He saw an ad in a newspaper for a lawn bowling club that was looking for new junior members. I was surprised enough over a 12 year old reading a newspaper, let alone the fact that he really wanted to try lawn bowling. So, off my Dad and him went. Little did we know that was the first day of Erik’s lawn bowling adventure. For me to say he loved it was an understatement. He joined the club immediately, and despite being 50 years under the average demographic, he belonged there and was welcomed with open arms. Skipping ahead to August of 2014, Erik’s first tournament. He won 1 out of 11 games. Now... I know that doesn’t sound great but he won 1 game! His first tournament ever and he won a game! This was the first of many, many tournaments. Like I’m talking hundreds.                                Erik at his first tournamentIt seemed like he was living on the greens. Practices and games and tournaments ...his life revolved around lawn bowling. There is a remarkable lack of indoor lawn bowling spaces in Ontario so in the winter he had to work with what he could get. It got to the point where he was practicing in his coach’s office on industrial carpet. He even transformed my parent’s hallway into a green by placing a carpet runner over the hardwood floors and putting pillows lining the walls so he can practice right from home. In my opinion, he should be winning an award for over the top dedication.Slowly but surely losses became wins and wins became championship and we started realizing this kid was going places. Fast forward to December of 2016, now let me remind you Erik is 15 years old at this point. Erik was going to Glasgow, Scotland for a world championship tournament. I'm not going to lie I was a little jealous. But regardless of my jealousy he shocked absolutely everybody, including me, when he won gold at the U25 World Indoor Bowls Council (WIBC) World Indoor Triples with his 2 partners (Dominic McVittie from England and Rebecca Houston from Scotland) Not only did that make him the first overseas winner of a WIBC gold medal but also the youngest male to win a U25 WIBC gold medal. You should see the trophy, it’s beautiful.                 Erik in Glasgow, Scotland at the WIBC World Indoor Triples                 Erik with his WIBC trophiesHere is a list of some of his major accomplishments: 2016 Ontario Junior Bowler of the Year7 Ontario Lawn Bowling Association District Championships3 Ontario provincial championships (Indoor singles, U18 2018 and U18 2019)Bowls Canada 2018 National Junior ChampionshipPBA Canada Pairs Championship (Twice 2017 and 2018) – this has allowed him to participate in the World Bowls Tour Indoor World Championships at Potters Resort in EnglandPBA U25 Canadian Singles Championship (Twice 2016 and 2017) – this allowed him to participate in the WIBC U25 World Indoor Championships in Glasgow Scotland and Norwich WalesIn November of 2018, Erik was chosen to be a member of the Canadian Men’s National Team at 17 years old                   Team CanadaI feel like we can all agree, Erik is damn good lawn bowler and he has had quite the journey so far! So now I will explain why I’m telling you all of this. Erik’s journey is about to take a leap to the next level. At one of Erik’s more recent tournaments he met two competitors named Kyle McIlroy and Dave Rankin, from Australia. They have invited Erik to play Pennant Bowls at the Doubleview Bowls Club in Perth, Australia starting the fall of 2019. Erik will practice with and compete against some of the best in the world. This will give him a chance to showcase his talent on a huge stage. This opportunity is a major step towards Erik reaching his goals; winning a gold medal for Canada at the commonwealth games,  returning home where he hopes to grow and develop the sport in Canada, and being part of opening a world class indoor facility in Southern Ontario.I am hoping we can raise $5000.00 to help him make the most of this opportunity to play pennant bowls in Australia. This money will go a long way towards helping him cover the expenses associated with travelling to Australia, training down under, and being a member on the Canadian National Team. So there it is. My little brother, the lawn bowler. Also, one of the most talented, hardworking and dedicated kids I have ever met. Nothing will make me sadder than watching him get on a plane to the other side of the world, but at the same time, nothing will make me happier than to watch him chase his dream, even if his dream is on the other end of a flight to Australia. So please help us get Erik Galipeau out of the country.Finally, I want to thank everyone for their support and generosity. As a good friend of our family once said, “I just want to be a part of this kids journey” You can be too by following Erik on this on his Instagram page @erikgalipeaubowls. Also, stay tuned for my next go fund me titled “Fly Erik’s Sister to Australia to Visit”.(Eric Galipeau)","July 4, 2019","$2,440","$5,000 "

Due to our frail income, young ages, and expensive cross-border relationship (I'm American, she's Canadian), we married quickly at the Chapel Of Crystals in Las Vegas.

She's my light, my life, my wife.However, due to bad luck upon bad luck, we still cannot command the income we are worth. I've worked many dead-ends jobs, even been not paid by my so-called ""employers"" illegally. After all, I don't have the money to afford lawyer fees. Right now, I am working as a housekeeper and handyman, even though I have management experience. My employer won't pay me more due to his business slowly failing. He pays me $200/week for doing two jobs. $200/week is barely groceries. We're stuck. I've applied everywhere but received no replies. I'm hard-working with no criminal background, but like I said, bad luck seems to follow us wherever we go. We've been homeless twice in the past two years, lost our good car in a major wreck injuring us both, been financially scammed, lived through 4 cities (still counting), driven across the entire American East Coast in a beater car (twice), applied in every town, village, and city on our way, but alas, no replies! Just silence. Please send some luck our way! We can't wrap our heads around it either.All I want is my wife Grace, and for us to stop this incessant limbo between the USA and Canada. We both come from low-income families and they cannot help us anymore than they already have. Please, help us be together. Help me stay with my wife. We want to settle in Florida, where I live, somewhere in the countryside. I will work as many hours as I need, anywhere at all, in order to be with her.With these funds, we will apply for Grace's spousal visa, cover her travel costs, and we'd also love the opportunity to build a minimalist tiny house on some cheap land (or buy an RV to live in), foster crops for our family using sustainable organic practices, and if life allows, maybe even own a dog. It's a simple dream, can you help us today? Maybe spare this morning's cup of coffee?Thank you so much for your consideration. I can add more photos and details, if any interest arises.

Sylvie Levert ,"Azilda, ON","Medical, Illness & Healing","#FIGHT4KERRYKerry is a vibrant, loving 39 year old mother, wife, sister, aunt, daughter and my best friend that is battling breast cancer for a 4th time!  She has spent the better part of her life as a mom - as a cancer patient.Help me help Kerry get the best possible treatment so she can finally beat this awful disease so she can raise her son and see him become a compassionate and loving young man.HISTORY:Kerry grew up in a small northern town of Sudbury, Ontario where she met the love of her life, bought a house and lived the fairy tale life that every little girl dreams about.  This fairy tale also included having the cutest baby boy Ryley in 2012.  That is where this fairy tale ends because Ryley has had to grow up watching his mom fight cancer since he has been two years old.  The word Cancer is a part of his speech that is normal for him but we all know that it shouldn't be part of anyone's vocabulary - especially at such a young age.  He has witnessed the effects of this horrendous disease all of his entire life and is still living thru the ups and downs of not knowing.  This beautiful family needs a chance to live a life free of worry from this despicable disease!  She was first diagnosed in 2014 at the young age of 35, with stage 1 Triple Negative breast cancer (TNBC). She underwent a lumpectomy, 6 cycles of chemo and 30 rounds of radiation. She did well until May 2016 when she got the bad news once again. So she received 6 more rounds of chemo followed by a bilateral mastectomy in Sept 2016. A PET scan was performed and the results came back negative for cancer, so no further treatments were needed at that point. She thought she had finally battled and beat cancer! Unfortunately in August 2017 she was given the bad news once again after a routine follow up appointment. She went onto 6 more months of chemo, more surgery and another 28 rounds of radiation.  A chest CT was performed and results showed no more signs of cancer.  Kerry beat it for a third time! On July 26, 2018 after a another routine CT chest scan & chest ultrasound she was diagnosed a 4th time. The left side came back positive for Metastatic ductal carcinoma.  TREATMENT:Even with being diagnosed four times, she is still positive and determined more than ever to BEAT this disease that has afflicted her for so long for the sake of loving life and her family more than ever.  GIVING UP IS NOT AN OPTION! Her treatment options at this time are as follows:  1)  her Canadian doctors are getting a second opinion from Toronto specialists to evaluate if surgery is an option at this point and to radiate, but fears it may not be promising given her history and pour results of all previous treatments.  A referral has also been sent to Princess Margaret in Toronto, Ontario to exhaust all possible treatments in Canada. 2)  Kerry has been exploring alternative cancer treatments not currently available in Canada, and has reached out to cancer clinics in Germany. These clinics offer specialized treatments such as regional chemotherapy (RCT). RCT has had good response rates for people in Kerry’s situation. However, pursuing this treatment is costly - approximately $200,000. She has a lot to think about and is considering all of the suggestions from her Canadian doctors, German hospitals and cancer clinics which offer the world's most advanced treatments.  Time is of the essence since it has already been 4 weeks since she has been diagnosed for the 4th time and no treatment plan has been set forth yet.  Regardless of where she decides to follow up with treatments, there are financial strains such as travelling and accommodations that will be incurred.There is HOPE!Several Canadians have explored the alternative cancer treatments and have had positive results.  Kerry has been in contact with a local survivor - a young woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer that had metastasized - that was in much of the same situation as she is currently in . This Canadian girl was told that she only had a few months to live. She decided to take fate into her own hands and went to Germany for RCT.  Her recent PET scan shows that there are no further signs of cancer.  And Sudbury also has a Chelmsford man attending the Germany clinic in September 2018 with positive anticipation of good news.  Please help Kerry finally beat this disease and get back to being a great mother, wife, sister, aunt, daughter and my best friend.  She needs your help to lessen the financial burdens that his awful disease has put on her and her family.   Please donate since time of the essence.Donate today!God bless you for all of your best wishes, prayers and generosity!","September 9, 2018","$159,922","$200,000 "

Marissa Hayes ,"Balmoral, QLD","Sports, Teams & Clubs","Hi Football Family,It’s Marissa here. For those of you who don’t know, I have recently been selected to represent Australia in the FIRST EVER Women’s National Gridiron Team. It will be a privilege to create history and play such an integral part of growing the game in Australia, especially for women. In 2010, the International Federation of American Football (IFAF) held the first Women’s World Championship event in Stockholm, Sweden, with 6 countries competing. Hosted every 4 years, the 2017 IFAF Women’s World Cup will be held this June in Langley, Canada where Australia will field its first ever Women’s National Team in America Football. It is there that we will compete against 5 other countries – USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Mexico and Finland.During my short time within the sport, I have been fortunate enough to represent my state, competing for the Queensland Sundevils in the inaugural Women’s Australian Gridiron League competition in 2014. In 2016, I once again earned that honour, with the first game taking place in April. In addition to state selection, I was privileged enough in 2016 to be selected amongst the most talented women in Australia to fight for an international position at the Australian Outback Women’s Selection Camp for the 2017 IFAF World Cup Championships. I am sincerely humbled, to say the least, that I earned a spot on the 52-women roaster.Unfortunately, with women’s sport both underappreciated and unrecognised throughout Australia, as well as the little to no corporate sponsorship for individuals in our amateur sport, such an international event is completely self-funded by the athletes. Thus, the reality of a childhood dream of representing the green and gold is somewhat diminished with the thought of such a financial burden… that’s why I need YOUR help. For the price of a coffee (or a schooner!) you could make a big difference in helping make my dream come true. Funds raised go towards all my team fees such as flights, accommodation, unifrom and administration fees.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and every donation made helps me get closer to the World Championships in Canada. So thank you to everyone who has supported me thus far on my journey and I hope to do you all proud!For partial or full sponsorship packages, please contact me via phone, email or the link below.

Elizabeth Calvin ,"Uxbridge, ON",Non-Profits & Charities," A unique concentration of public lands and walking trails lies north east of Toronto. These trails, which travel through forests and across gurgling streams, stretch across the gentle rolling hills in the southern part of Uxbridge Township and northwards into the town of Uxbridge, “Trail Capital of Canada”. Soon this trail network will connect with the new Rouge National Urban Park and will also be accessible by public transit. Already many walkers, hikers, cross-country skiers and snowshoers travel from far and wide to enjoy this natural area. But information about the trails – how to get to them and how to avoid getting lost – is not easy to come by. Several different organizations manage the lands and trails, each with separate and incomplete map systems of varying quality. For some areas, maps do not even exist. Green Durham Association, a not-for-profit charitable organization dedicated to protecting, preserving and enhancing the forests, farmlands and natural areas in this region, plans to develop a set of comprehensive trail maps to help people find their way to these beautiful trails. GDA has commissioned a local recreational map-making company to create high quality waterproof maps which will provide detailed “in the field” trail guides for users. Our goal is to highlight the trail system and provide essential information to assist to help new users feel confident about exploring this beautiful area. The maps will be developed in stages; we hope to reach our fundraising goal by Canadian Thanksgiving, 2016 to fund the first set of maps.  Sales of the maps will help generate funds to continue this project. Maps will be sold at local businesses and at regional and national outdoor stores. Please donate and help us make this ambitious project a reality! GDA can issue you a receipt for charitable donations over $20.

Ken Bell ,"Blenheim, ON",Other,"Water is life. Fresh water is the lifeblood of Ontario and Canada. The Great lakes and the vast majority of rivers and streams that feed them were once all drinkable and home to complex, varied and stable ecosystems for many thousands of years of human settlement after the last ice age. Over the past 150 years there has been a dramatic and devastating loss of  biological diversity and degrading of water quality. By comparison, this cannot be understated.   Although solutions to water pollution are technically simple and economically feasible, clean water is a political “hot potato”. Few if any are willing to accept responsibility and fewer still implement long term, research based solutions. Here, in Southwestern Ontario problems are magnified due to the low topography, rich soils, lack of forest cover, intensive urban and agricultural development and lack of effective regulation of nutrient outflows.   Added to this mix are the cuts to core regulatory funding that included extensive source water testing. The regulatory system we have now does not seek to prevent pollution, but only mitigate point and non point sources after runoffs have occurred. Without monitoring, most persistent nutrient outflows go unchecked and unnoticed until secondary effects like cyanobacteria blooms turn our once drinkable waters, toxic green.  microcystis, 200x (source Rondeau Bay) Most have read, heard or have seen the effects of excessive nutrient pollution. This leads to lakes and bays experiencing eutrophication, which is essentially a shutting down of the ecology due to lack of dissolved oxygen.  Both Canada and the U.S. recognize the massive scale of this problem and have cosigned the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement http://www2.epa.gov/glwqa    There are some huge nutrient sources like the Maumee River and Thames River that hold bi-national significance. Rondeau Bay and the surrounding subwatershed also have serious pollution problems, but aren’t an international priority.Priority Areas serviced by the GLWQAMuch of this area is outside of priority jurisdictions.This short video, shows a very green Rondeau Bay  Microcystis from Rondeau Bay, Sept. 27th 2015The next step is to regularly test streams and rivers within the Rondeau Watershed around Chatham Kent for nutrients.    Further below, I'm going to present a funding proposal for a Citizen-Based Water Quality Monitoring Program. First though, some I'd like to outline some of our water quality issues, who are being affected and some of the work already completed towards solutions.The image below shows the present extent of the Ontario  stream monitoring network ‌.Monitoring in the lower Southwest is sparse. Zooming into Chatham Kent (lower left) The image shows over 4000km of streams in Chatham Kent.  Many are sources of nutrient pollution(nitrogen and phosphorus) along the Thames and Sydenham Rivers, Lake St Clair, Rondeau Bay and Lake Erie.Chatham Kent is like a giant kidney, filtering into the lifeblood of our planet,  Water.This once great ecological infrastructure is being slowly dismantled.Over 96% of the once great forests have been cleared for export driven agriculture.Marshes and estuaries have been hardened with broken concrete waste.Agricultural ""Best Management Practices"" are only occasionally applied.(compost dump leaching into Rondeau Bay)Expensive remediation projects often remain untested and uncertified.For those living in cities, water quality has a real value.""The public needs to know that there is a measurable return on public investment.""That's what publishing the results of water sampling and analysis does. Using the ethos of honesty, transparency, open questioning, reliance on evidence and peer review a well informed public can drive public policy.So let's start with some comparisons. This is what a stream should look like.  The water is clear with some tannins with lots of fish, amphibians, invertebrates and a variety of emergent plants.(Willow Creek)Here's another healthy stream in Chatham Kent, Clear Creek shaded and filtered by the forest.Some streams have higher levels of Phosphorus and Nitrogen from agricultural and urban runoff...(Morpeth Drain, spring)...while others have much higher levels.(3rd Concession Drain , summer)Many agricultural areas have achieved a balance. Some algae, some invasives, but generally heathy.(Tributary of the Snye )Over time, the runoff of these nutrients can pollute Lake Erie and Lake St Clair, producing huge toxic algae blooms.(Clearville Oct.2011)When the algae dies during the late fall it sinks to the bottom and decays. This uses up all of the oxygen, below the ""thermocline"", a layer of cold water at the bottom of the lake.  This decay can also produce toxic hydrogen sulfide. The following years, when the surface waters cool in early autumn, the oxygen depleted, toxic water below the thermocline is displaced by the sinking cool surface waters. An entire near-shore ecosystem can collapse as this 2012 photo taken in south Chatham-Kent shows.Below you can see the 2012 progression of the swirl of black oxygen depleted, toxic water that killed nearshore fish over a 50 km stretch of the Lake Erie shoreline.Many vertebrate species are affected by water quality. Some are very sensitive.Bald Eagles fish and nest along the Erie Shore and Thames and Sydenham Rivers.Red Brested Merganzers bioaccumulate aquatic toxins.The same with Great Egrets,...Kingfishers,...Wood Ducks...Chorus Frogs...and Mink.                           And Us! We can only know the health of specific locations by sampling, testing and analysis .This is where Volunteers come in!In partnership with the University of Guelph, the Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority and the Rondeau Watershed Coalition we began in 2005, a 5 year sampling and testing program throughout the Rondeau Watershed.2007 sampling in Rondeau BayThis included Field Courses in Rapid Bioassessment Protocols.By counting the numbers and types of aquatic invertebrates a streams health and levels of pollutants can be accurately assessed.An integral part of the program is sampling and analysis.This 5 year program helped to establish a baseline for nutrients and metals within the Rondeau Watershed and Clear Creek.Now it's time to move into a more comprehensive Citizen Science based program that produces published evidence based assessments of local streams and rivers.With this, we would like to ask for your help.Citizen BasedWater Quality Monitoring The Great Lakes Community Eco Initiative, in partnership with St Clair college Chemical Lab Tech Dept. and University of Guelph Ridgetown Campus, will conduct a stream sampling and testing program focusing on nutrient outflows into Lake Erie and Lake St Clair. Sampling would be on a student volunteer/internship basis and would correspond to runoff events and wet seasons as well as a regularly timed series. The scope of 1st year sampling will be the Rondeau Watershed, the Chatham-Kent, Erie Shoreline and the Thames River upstream and downstream from Chatham, for the purpose of identifying point and non-point nutrient sources in excess of background levels. Both surface and benthic samples will be taken. Where possible Level 2-3 Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (RBP-2) will be used in the field. RBP-3 will be used for training and expanding knowledge of species level tolerances of pollutants. Field tests will include Temp, pH, Conductivity, Turbidity, DO as well as a site assessment that include photos, coordinates, weather conditions and impressions (anything unusual). The focus of testing will be to measure Nitrogen (TKN), Total Phosphorus and toxic metals (Hg, Pb, Zn, Cu) as well as fecal coliforms and BODs from benthic samples. The scope of analysis will be to identify specific point sources geophysically, chemically and biologically as well as the general health of water courses from RBP-2 results. The data will be made publicly available in a quarterly report, published online.http://greatlakescei.ca Project partners will be; Great Lakes Community Eco Initiative University of Guelph Ridgetown Campus St Clair College The project will work with the Ministry of the Environment & Climate Change, the Municipality of Chatham-Kent and the Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority.

Richard Johnson ,"Canberra, AU","Creative Arts, Music & Film","(Please see rewards below)SoundOut is an annual International festival of Free improvisation, Free Jazz and Experimental Musics + held in Canberra. Due to a shortfall in funding from our local government we are running this campaign to ensure the festival continues to realise it's vision of bringing exceptional and innovative music to the South-East region of Australia. We are now in our 11th year as one of the gateway exploratory music-art events providing a much-needed avenue for brilliant musical endeavors from around the world and Australia. We see our role as fostering continued creative collaborations between some of the best Artists, the world has to offer, and our own brilliant Australian artists and showcasing these to the community. In 2020 we have 23 Artists from Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany and the UK that will combine, cross-fertilize, and move sound mountains to uplift your ears and replenish the mind during the 2 day event, which spans approximately 18 hrs of music, over 22 sets.  There will also be a SoundOut Workshop on the Friday the 31st January 2020 9am - 5pm at the School of Music Big Band Room with Annette Krebs Konstruktion #4 ; Elisabeth Harnik piano; and Achim Kaufmann [piano]Trio with Frank Gratkowski saxophone and Wilbert de Joode double bass. Please see below for rewards details. See link below to web blog for further info: http://soundout2020.blogspot.com.au/ facebook events pageFestival: https://www.facebook.com/events/399407957610095/ Workshop: moved to the Drill Hall Gallery ANU, from 10am - 2pm  We need to remain strong in our resolve to continue the festival as it is vital part of of the Australian cultural landscape otherwise we face becoming an “endangered cultural species”. We are running this Gofundme campaign to raise desperately needed funds to cover costs of Artist fees, some travel, accommodation, food, and production and advertising costs. SoundOut will be hosted on the 1st and 2nd of February 2020 and thus we are endeavoring to raise the funds by late January to be ensured of a successful festival. Your generous support will mean the difference between survival and closure of the festival and cannot be underestimated. It would help us through another year as we try to ensure greater sustainability. It also means that artists have the opportunity to be heard and supported in a positive fruitful artistic environment, to showcase their skill and innovation to the broader community and be heard by their peers from around the world.On a personal level this support would mean the absolute world to me. I have been director/producer/curator of this festival for going on 10 years and though we have occasionally been lucky with funding we have not been that fortunate this year. I would personally fund the festival but work part-time in two jobs that as an Artist just pays the bills and thus it would take a HUGE weight off my shoulders to be able to fund this festival without being put into huge debt.

He started writing tunes around that time. Later he studied music at the Conservatory in Cologne and also took classes with creative masters such as Dave Holland, Steve Coleman, Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis, and Steve Lacy.  From 1996 to 2009, he lived in Amsterdam where he became part of that city’s internationally renowned improvised music scene.  Since 2002, he has been touring internationally with the trio Kaufmann/Gratkowski/de Joode, an improvising unit which has released four CDs so far, to much critical acclaim.  In the late ‘90s and ‘00s, Achim led two groups with reed player Michael Moore: trio kamosc and gueuledeloup quartet.  In 2007, he recorded kyrill, a set of compositions for piano trio featuring Valdi Kolli and Jim Black. Their follow-up cd, entitled verivyr, was released in 2011.  He has also collaborated with his wife, poet/painter Gabriele Guenther, on the audiodrama Borderline – From the Shadows of a Journey, and has written music for various chamber ensembles.  In his solo work, mixed techniques are used to create a fluctuating world of sounds and gestures. Resonance and reverberation, space and density play an important role in both his solo and ensemble work.  Since his move to Berlin, he got involved in various new projects, such as the trio grünen with Robert Landfermann and Christian Lillinger, Oni Kramler (with Matthias Schubert, Antonio Borghini, and various guests), and a trio with cellist Okkyung Lee and trumpeter Axel Dörner.  In 2013, the sextet SKEIN (Kaufmann/Gratkowski/de Joode plus Richard Barrett, Okkyung Lee, and Tony Buck) had its premiere at the dOeK festival in Amsterdam and subsequently recorded for SWR radio.   He recently released duo albums with long-standing collaborators Michael Moore and Thomas Heberer.  In addition, Achim has played and/or recorded with  Han Bennink, Mark Dresser, George Lewis, Steve Swallow, Tobias Delius, Wolter Wierbos, Mark Helias, Paul Rutherford, Thomas Lehn, Ab Baars, Paul Lovens, Dylan van der Schyff, Peggy Lee, Chris Speed, Tomász Stanko, Gerd Dudek, Bill Elgart, Paul Lytton, Harri Sjöström, Andrea Parkins, Harris Eisenstadt, Ingrid Laubrock, Tristan Honsinger, Shelley Hirsch, Steve Swell, Thomas Heberer, Urs Leimgruber, Roger Turner, Fay Victor, Fred Lonberg-Holm, John Hollenbeck, Bob Brookmeyer, Simon Nabatov, Lê Quan Ninh, Gerry Hemingway, John Hébert, Al Foster, Adam Nussbaum, and many more.  He was awarded the German SWR Jazz Award in 2001, and the prestigious Albert Mangelsdorff award in 2015.  “For many years, Achim Kaufmann has been one of the most inspiring and exciting personalities of the European jazz and improvisation scene. His music bears witness to great harmonic subtlety and structural depth. A brilliant pianist and composer, his reflected exploration of tradition has led him to a nuanced, contemporary sound language that encompasses poetry, energy and abstraction in equal measure.”  http://www.achimkaufmann.com/      https://youtu.be/5wg1MfS4V4MAlexander Spence: Clarinet, electronics, SydneyAlexandra works within the fields of sound installation, composition, and improvised music. Alex is interested in the idea of listening as an active practice. She is inspired by the idea of ‘collaborating’ with one’s environment, understanding the relationships between the listener, sound, and the surrounding environment to be a kind of communion or conversation. Her work favours subtlety, quietude and unusual sound sources. Alex has performed and presented work in concerts, festivals, symposiums and galleries in Australia, Canada, and Europe, including the Women In Sound/Women.  On Sound forum: Educating Girls in Sound, Lancaster, UK; NOW now Festival, Sydney, AU; Is This Art? dLux Media Arts, Sydney, AU; Destroy Vancouver, CA; Toronto International Electroacoustic Symposium, CA; and the FKL Symposium, Besenello, IT.

The Alister Spence Trio has enjoyed critical acclaim, being nominated twice for Best Australian Jazz Album at the ARIA Awards (2004/2007). Their 7th release, Not Everything but Enough was voted in ‘Top 10 Jazz Albums 2017’ in Music Magazine, Japan, and received ‘Honorary Mention, Best of 2017’ in the New York City Jazz Record.   Alister has also established creative collaborative relationships with internationally recognised improvisers in Japan, Scotland, Sweden, and the US. Since 2008 he has toured and performed with acclaimed Japanese pianist/composer, Satoko Fujii in Japan, Australia, the US and Canada. In 2018 they released three CDs together, including Bright Force (Libra Records), which was described as ‘awe-inspiring music’ 4.5 stars (allaboutjazz.com). Alister has also recorded and toured for many years in Europe, Australia and Japan, with Raymond MacDonald (saxophone, Glasgow). They have released two improvised music albums as a duo, and three as ‘Sensaround,’ an electro-acoustic open-improvisation trio which includes guitarist/electronic musician Sia Ahmad. In 2014 Alister’s improvised piano-duo album, Everything Here is Possible with US pianist Myra Melford received an APRA/AMCOS Art Music Award, and his improvised music trio with Swedish musicians Joe Williamson and Christopher Cantillo was nominated for the same award in 2015. ‘This is the sound of genuine discovery, founded upon decades of experience but unfettered by habit.’  Bill Meyer, Dusted Magazine, US (review of intelsat: Spence/Fujii)    ‘Spence has that priceless gift of always leaving you wanting more.’  Jazzwise Magazine, UK       https://www.alisterspence.com/Amanda Stewart: sound performance artist, SydneyAmanda is a poet, writer and performer who lives in Sydney.  Since the late seventies she has created and presented a variety of poetic works, performances, radio and multimedia works in Australia, Japan, USA and Europe. In 1989, together with Jim Denley, Chris Mann, Rik Rue and Stevie Wishart, she cofounded Machine for Making Sense, with whom she continues to collaborate.  Also, in 1995, she founded the trio Allos with Anne la Berge and Jim Meneses.

On stage, she is one of the most powerful and accomplished Australian poets and this will be her first appearance in Barcelona. Recently she has become part of the new trio “180 degrees” with Jim Denley and Nick Ashwood with their album Sub Mental just released.  https://splitrec.bandcamp.com/album/submentalAnnette Krebs: Konstruktion #4, GermanySince 2013, Annette Krebs has developed and recorded instrumental assemblages of highly amplified metals, strings, objects and microphones. These assemblages ""Construction # 1"" to ""Construction # 4"" were originally born out of the need to realize sound visions that could not be played with traditional instruments and setups. Like microscopes, microphones make the finest, otherwise inaudible sound shades and colors of the sound objects audible. The construction series combines analogue and digital techniques and playing styles. The signals of the manually played sound objects are controlled via tablets, transformed and similar to different colors that flow into each other, mix together or stand side by side, musically collaged. The course of time, of stagnant, flowing, frozen time, is explored within the series and sculpturally processed. Annette Krebs was born in Saarland and lives since 1993 in Berlin. Since childhood she plays numerous instruments and is engaged in visual arts. She completed her music studies at the HfMDK in Frankfurt am Main. Before she began developing the series Construction, she gradually deconstructed her original instrument guitar. She was portrayed in 2002 in the magazine ""The Wire- Adventures in modern music"" (UK) with her first solo CD ""guitar solo"" (""Fringes Recordings"", IT). Their last guitar composition ""rush"", an acoustic collage that reduces the sounds of the guitar to a final cockroach and cracking, appeared in 2014 on the label ""Another Timbre - The Berlin Series no.2"" (UK).   Annette Krebs performs as a soloist and in various ensembles worldwide at concerts and festivals (including ""100 Years of Bauhaus-The Opening Festival"", ""Donaueschinger Musiktage"", ""Heroines Of Sound Festival"", ""Contacts - Biennale for Electroacoustic Music and Sound Art"").   Her music has received numerous grants (including ""Senate Department for Culture and Europe"", Berlin, ""Goethe-Institut"", ""Cité Internationale des Arts Paris"", ""Academy of Arts"", Berlin, ""EMS Elektronmusik Studion"", Stockholm) and presented on the radio and in the press (eg ""Positions-Texte zur aktuelle Musik"", ""Deutschlandradio Kultur"", ""WDR-3"", ""BR Klassik"").   In addition to her artistic work, she teaches her techniques and helps others to develop their musical expression.    https://www.annettekrebs.eu/Arthur Bull: guitarist, CanadaGuitarist Arthur Bull has been active on the Canadian free improvisation scene since the ‘70s. Much like his compatriot, pianist Al Neil, or the British guitarist Roger Smith, he has kept a low profile and has remained cruelly under-documented. His playing draws inspiration in Derek Bailey's musical vocabulary, with maybe a hint of folk or American roots music in the phrasing. Bull is also a poet, with three collections published in Canada and a translator from Chinese to English. In the early 2000s he was earning a living developing local resource management programs for fishing communities in Nova Scotia, Canada.  Bull's music career starts in Toronto where he was living when American free jazz and European Free Improvisation began to stir interest in Canadian musicians. He took an active part in the communities of artists active in the '70s and '80s, playing with the CCMC -- Toronto's longest-running free improv group -- Michael Snow, the Bill Smith Ensemble, the Paul Cram Ensemble, David Prentice, John Oswald, and Paul Dutton. He occasionally accompanied the spoken word/sound poetry quartet the Four Horsemen (Dutton, Rafael Barreto-Rivera, Steve McCaffery, and BP Nichol) and shared the stage with such luminaries as Derek Bailey and Roscoe Mitchell when they were in town.   In 1990 he moved to Sandy Cove, a small village of fishermen in Nova Scotia. Momentarily disheartened with music, he focused on his writing, publishing Hawthorn and Key to the Highway. In 1996 he hooked up with Daniel Heïkalo, another experimental guitarist -- this one from Montreal -- who had moved to the Maritime province a decade earlier and lived nearby. The duo has been playing regularly since 1999. The release of the CD Dérapages à Cordes on the label Ambiances Magnétiques in 2000 marked Bull's ""comeback"" to public music. A solo disc, Guitar Solo, followed in 2001 on his friend's imprint Heïkalo Sound Productions. In May of that year, the group appeared at the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville. In 2002 they performed at the Guelph Jazz Festival and Guitarévolution (Montréal).       http://www.arthbull.ca/Ben Drury: double bass, CanberraBenjamin Drury is a composer, sound artist, improviser and beat maker, who lives in Canberra, Australia.   His practise encompasses experimental, popular and classical music, drawing inspiration from a wide and varied collection of sources.   He completed a Bachelor of Music from the ANU School of Music in 2017.   During his time at ANU he was awarded the Harold Wesley Allen Memorial prize (2016, 2017) the ANZCA Composition prize (2016, 2017) and the Dennis Griffin Piano Undergraduate Scholarship (2017).   As a composer, he is fascinated by all facets of sound and audio culture.  His works explore the presentation and reception of sound as well as exploring sound itself.  He is interested in challenging traditional performance models and creating new ways of presenting music.  In the past he has done this through interactive installations like his work Modified Furniture (2017) and site-specific performances like Pieces for Cars Tunnel and Hexagonal Vents (2016).   Sonically his practise explores acoustics, noise and form, seeking ways to subvert the expectations of both art and pop music audiences. He has had works performed by Claire Edwards (CSO Solo Series, 2019, and the Canberra International Music Festival, 2018,), Rohan Dasika (Canberra International Music Festival, 2017,) and Ensemble Offspring (Australian National University, 2016).  He had a work read by Eighth Blackbird (2017) for a public workshop with Musica Viva.  He has performed and had works featured in a variety of festivals including: Canberra International Music Festival (2017, 2018) SoundOut (2016, 2017, 2018) You Are Here (2015, 2016, 2017) Art Not Apart (2016) Tilde~ (2017).  He also plays bass in the band Helena Pop, improvises with Bomber Ensemble, and creates experimental pop music under his own name.   His debut album, Sentence Fragment: Consider Revising, a collection of deconstructed hip-hop beats was released in 2017. He is also part of the recently formed Phage Trio along with invented electronic instrumented builder Brian McNamarra and wind instrumentalist Richard Johnson.Brian McNamarra: invented electronic instruments, CanberraBrian is an experimental instrument builder and sound sculpture artist based in Canberra, Australia. He mixes his passions for music, electronics and sculpture into unique objects that should need no explanation to play or experience but convey a deeper meaning in the context of their surroundings. Brian builds and performs with a range of experimental instruments, with a focus on both autonomous soundart sculptures and interactive installation instruments that require the engagement of multiple people or unusual kinetic movements to be played. His instruments include computer programmed elements, percussion, found sounds from used electronics and purpose designed oscillators.  A key feature of his work is audience movement and participation. Art functions best when the art space is inclusive of the public so through his exploration of experimental sounds he uses engagement with the audience as a medium to convey ideas. These explorations include the link between the environment and technology, our own movement around the planet with movement of those fleeing war torn areas and the link between our own minds and those we try to create in machines.              https://www.facebook.com/cupandbow/Dylan Van Der Schyff: percussion-drums, Melbourne/ CanadaDrummer/percussionist Dylan van der Schyff was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and immigrated to Canada in the mid 1970’s.

Articles about his work have appeared in publications such as Downbeat, Jazz Times, The Globe and Mail, The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Chicago Reader, The Wire, and Coda.  In addition to his activities as performer, Dylan also maintains an active academic career as a researcher in interdisciplinary musicology. His published work appears in journals that cover a broad spectrum of fields in the sciences and humanities. These include: Frontiers in Neuroscience; Phenomenology and Practice; Psychomusicology: Music Mind and Brain; Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences; Frontiers in Psychology; Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education; Interference: A Journal of Audio Culture; and Psychology of Music. He has also contributed chapters to a number of edited editions, including Oxford University Press handbooks. He is currently leading a coauthored book project entitled Musical Bodies, Musical Minds: Enactive Cognition and the Meaning of Human Musicality. It will be published by the MIT Press in 2020. Between 2017-2019 Dylan was a SSHRC research fellow at the University of Oxford. Beginning in 2020 he will be Senior Lecturer in Jazz and Improvised Music at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, University of Melbourne.      https://whirrboom.bandcamp.com/album/kamoscElisabeth Harnik: piano, AustriaElisabeth Harnik, an Austria based pianist and composer has created a multi-faceted body of work by blurring genre boundaries through various collaborations in the field of improvised music, interdisciplinary projects and contemporary compositional works. She studied classical piano and later – with Beat Furrer – composition at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Graz.

A self-taught musician, he has been playing the double-bass since 1982.  He began working in groups that improvised within a jazz framework. Other musicians were soon drawn to his idiosyncratic style, and in the mid 80s he played in groups led by Vera Vingerhoeds, Armando Cairo and Ig Henneman where he further developed his improvisation skills.  He came into contact with such musicians as J.C.Tans, Rinus Groeneveld, Michiel Braam, Han Bennink, Han Buhrs (Schismatics) and Ab Baars.  De Joode is currently one of the most active bass players on the European improvised music circuit. His individual style and musicality transforms the double bass into an equal partner in the most varied ensembles. A personal tone colour, exploration of the outer registers, quirky improvisations and the use of gut strings contribute to an instantly recognizable and intriguing sound.   The seventeen improvised pieces on his first solo cd Olo (distributed by ToonDist) show how rich and complex his sound on the double bass is.https://youtu.be/5wg1MfS4V4M","November 11, 2019","$10,115","$12,000 "
Marielos Morice Poveda ,,Non-Profits & Charities,"The Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center is a non-profit organization that gives animals a second chance at life. Our dedicated staff and selfless volunteers work tirelessly to help these animals heal, keep them safe, rehabilitate them, and eventually re-release them into their natural habitat in the Costa Rican rainforest.During their stay at our Rescue Center we want to provide the animals with the most beautiful environment to maintain their quality of lives with new toys and enrichment items. Of course any medical and veterinarian supply is urgently needed too. Because of the fact we do not receive any kind of governmental support, we rely on the volunteers work and donations! Every single donation, no matter how small,  counts and means a lot to us! You can find out more about us, our volunteers and our animals here: http://www.costaricaanimalrescuecenter.org/ History of the Project and Rescue CenterIn 2004, Marielos Marice and Bernal Lizano (founders of the Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center) rented a 10-acre field in Moin, Costa Rica. Moin is near the city of Limon, an area of poverty and poor economic conditions. This land was rented from a Canadian Company, Canadian Eastern Developments or CASA Canada. The purpose of renting this land was to create a wildlife sanctuary and this location between the sea and river was the perfect location, as it was also a natural corridor for animals.  Funded by private donations, with no help from government whatsover, an animal hospital was built, gardens created and paths constructed. There was a pool for turtles, a butterfly dome, and huge cages. Many animals were freed. Over the years, the Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center (Paradero) got better and bigger. Tours were given to tourists, a language academy was on site and endangered and threatened animals were brought here to be cared for, rehabilitated,  housed and often released back into the wild. Nearly every animal brought to the sanctuary was endangered due to massive destruction of protected areas. There were even manatees which were declared the national symbol for marine wildlife in Costa Rica in July 2014.The president of Costa Rica in 2013 was Laura Chinchilla, one of the least popular presidents in Latin America at that time. Under her leadership, the land the sanctuary was on became an area of public interest and with no consultation with the center, the land was expropriated from CASA Canada.  No money was given to the center for improvements to the land and all funds were given to CASA Canada only. This is against Costa Rican Law. These ten acres of land were a natural corridor for wildlife and in 1995, RAMSAR had declared it a Wildlife Refuge, “crucial for humanitarian interest”. This conflict is presently in the courts and the government has attempted to erase the fact that the center was there at all.Jairo's storyThe 2 KM-long stretch of beach in front of Moin is a habitat for Leatherback Turtles. This was the largest nesting ground for the endangered species in the Caribbean. Many volunteers, including police, gave their time to help protect these animals. Jairo Mora Sandoval was one of them. He was a young sea turtle worker for an NGO and came to the beach regularly for years to help the turtles. On May 31, 2013 this young man was murdered. His naked, beaten body was tied behind a truck and he was dragged up and down the beach. Jairo died of asphyxiation. In July of that year, arrests were made and even though geolocators and phone transcripts put 2 men on the beach that night, there were no convictions, Evidence was ""lost"" and omitted under Judge Alvarado. As a result of this violent murder, the volunteers who patrolled the beach became afraid. The beach was no longer protected or safe, and became open to poachers.The Loss of the Moin Rescue CenterIn 2013, a bid was launched to build a commercial port on the Moin beach where the Rescue Center was located. It was won by a company from The Netherlands who has 80-mega ports worldwide. In December 2013, pending an environmental study, the project was good to go. The company approached the center asking them to be the face of the project. Representatives came, took pictures and said they would stay in touch. The company also promised to build a learning center for schools on-site. Documents for the environmental assessment were lost 5 times by the government and when the company finally came to the table, it was with an assessment lead by biologist Mr. Chacon. Mr. Chacon once worked with and was Jairo Sandoval’s boss. He now worked as the biologist for the Dutch company. He studied  the beach and declared that there would be no negative environmental impact as there were no Leatherbacks on the beach! This final assessment was done quietly and gave the company the environmental green-light they needed to move forward and build their mega-port. At this time Marielos and Bernal went to the company, certain that they would save the center. The company wanted no part of it.In 2015, there was a huge celebration of the sale of the land and creation of a port,  and congratulations went out from the government to the company. Police removed Sarita Chinchilla(Coordinator of the volunteers/Manager of the Center) who ran the Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center (Paradero) Sanctuary from the celebrations. The ten acres of land where Jairo was killed and 40 acres of sea land were taken for the building of the proposed port. A 3 KM road was built on the biological corridor.In January 2015, the company asked the center to vacate the land. Bernal would not give up the Rescue Center without a fight and contacted an environmental lawyer, Lic. Rojas, who wanted to help save the sanctuary. Mr. Rojas said that everything that was done to put the port in place was illegal. On February 4, 2015 the center was given 5 days to move 67 animals from the site. They had no money, no trucks and no place to go. They were told that if the center was still in operation on February 9th then all the animals would be taken. Mr. Rojas stepped in and managed to get an extension of one month.This is the day Moin cried.During this month,  the government came in and cut down surrounding trees, as instructed by the shipping company. Monkeys (three different species), sloths and birds lost their habitat and died. The sound of chainsaws and machinery surrounded the center. During this time, a drive-by shooting put 6 bullets in Mr. Rojas’ home, and Sarita Chinchilla was followed and watched, and feared for her life. Her dog disappeared. Conservationists turned their backs on her, did not listen to her and wrote her off as possibly suicidal, as rumours had been spread that she would take her own life due to pressure. This was not true. Four hours drive away, a veterinarian offered the center his 12 acres to recreate the Wildlife Center. During the next frantic 3 weeks trucks went back and forth, sometimes making 2 round trips a day to transfer cages and animals. Due to the travel and stress on the animals, 14 sloths, an owl and 5 2-toed sloths that the center had, died. The spirit of the volunteers kept the center alive. Two weeks after the move there were 14 volunteers and by in July 2015 the number had gone up to 38 volunteers.The situation today and how you can help The building of the port is moving forward.  To make the cement that will create a 2-acre island in the sea, 7 million tons of stone are needed, so on top of all the destruction already done to the biological area of Moin, a mountain is being mined. There are 2 ports on this coast already. Wouldn't it have been better to improve these ports rather than build another one? Will this cause the other ports to go bankrupt so that the company has complete control? The rescue center is currently renting a small 1.5 acre area, where it struggles to create a stimulating and comfortable habitat not only for the animals but also for the workers and the volunteers. The founders have found a 4.5 acre property with a river, fruit trees, large accomodation for volunteers and workers, a lot of space for bigger enclosures to guarantee better living conditions for the animals in our care and those to come, a pool for turtle rehabilitation and a release area for releasable animals among other great things.The new property is not very far away from our current location, and will improve the life of a lot of animals who need help and make the stay of volunteers and workers more comfortable. However, due to the struggle of the Rescue Center for the past years describe above, funds are running low.This is why we need your help raising money for the new property. Thank you a lot for your help, however small,  we really appreciate it - it really makes a difference for the Rescue Center's future and its ability to help animals and the environment.German text/deutscher Text:Das Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center ist eine unabhängige Organisation, die Tieren eine zweite Chance im Leben gibt. Hierbei verfolgen wir auf freiweilliger Basis ausschliesslich dieses Ziel. Unser ausgebildetes Personal und unsere selbstlosen Voluntäre arbeiten unermütlich um diesen Tieren zu helfen, sie zu schützen, sie bei der Rehabilitation zu unterstützen, und sie nach Möglichkeit wieder in ihren Natürlichen Lebensraum im costarikanischen Regenwald auszusetzen.Während ihrem Aufenthalt im Rescue Center möchten wir den Tieren das schönste Umfeld bieten, um ihre Lebensqualität mit verschiedenen Spielzeugen und Beschäftigungen aufrecht zu erhalten. Selbstverständlich wird dafür auch ständig tiermedizinische Unterstützung benötigt. Da wir in keiner Form Unterstützung von der Regierung bekommen, sind wir auf die Unsterstützung der Freiwilligenarbeit und Spenden angewiesen.  Jede einzelne Spende – sei sie noch so klein – zählt und bedeutet uns eine Menge! Hier kannst du mehr über uns, unsere Voluntäre und unsere Tiere erfahren. http://www.costaricaanimalrescuecenter.org/ Geschichte des Projektes und des Rescue CentersIm Jahr 2004 mieteten Marielos Marice und Bernal Lizano (Gründer des “Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center”) eine vier Hektar grosse Fläche in Moin, Costa Rica. Moin liegt in der Nähe von Limon, ein Gebiet geprägt von Armut und schlechten wirtschaftlichen Verhältnissen. Dieses Land wurde gepachtet von einer Kanadischen Firma, “Canadian Eastern Developments” oder “CASA Canada”. Die Absicht dieses Land zu mieten, war eine Tierauffangstation ins Leben zu rufen, wofür dieser Ort zwischen dem Meer und einem Fluss ebenso aufgrund der natürlichen Umgebung für die Tiere wie geschaffen war. Durch finanzielle Unterstützung von privaten Spenden, jedoch ohne jegliche Hilfe der Regierung, konnte ein Tierkrankenhaus gebaut, Gärten errichtet und Wege geschaffen werden. Es gab ein Becken für die Schildkröten, einen Schmetterlingsgarten und riesige Gehege. Viele Tiere wurden ausgewildert und über die Jahre erweiterte sich das Costa Rica Rescue Center (Paradero). Es wurden Tours für Touristen angeboten, gleichzeitig war eine Sprachschule mit inbegriffen und viele gefährdete Tiere wurden aufgenommen, gepflegt, rehabilitiert und anschliessend wieder freigelassen. Beinahe jedes der aufgenommenen Tiere wurde durch die Zerstörung geschützter Gebiete gefährdet. Einige der Seekühe wurden sogar zu national Symbolen der Meerestierwelt von Costa Rica im Juli 2014 erklärt. In 2013 regierte Laura Chinchilla, einer der unbeliebtesten Präsidenten Latein Amerikas, das Land und unter ihrer Führung zog das Gebiet des Centers die Aufmerksamkeit der Öffentlichkeit auf sich und somit wurde der Besitz des Landes dem Center entzogen und an CASA Canada verkauft. Wider dem Costa Ricanischen Gesetz erhielt das Center nichts von den Einnahmen, da diese direct an CASA Canada gingen.Obwohl das Land seit 1995 zum Naturschutzgebiet erklärt worden ist, welches “essenziell für humanitäre Interessen” ist, liegt dieser Konflikt immernoch im Gericht vor, trotz Bemühungen ihn aus den Archiven zu löschen. Jairo´s GeschichteDer 2km lange Strand vor der Stadt Moin ist der grösste Lebensraum Lederrücken Schildkröten, welche vom Aussterben bedroht sind. Jairo Mora Sandoval, ein junger und leidenschaftlicher Retter von Schildkröten, half zusammen mit der Polizei und anderen Voluntären diese Tiere zu beschützen. Am 31sten Mai, 2013 wurde dieser junge Mann brutal ermordet. Sein nackter, misshandelter Körper wurde hinter einem Truck den Strand rauf und runter gezogen, bis er erstickte. Obwohl Haftbefehle erlassen wurden, fand keine Verurteilung statt, da die Beweise unter den Tisch gekehrt wurden.  Aufgrund dieser brutalen Ermordung, trauten die Voluntäre sich nicht mehr den Strand zu patrullieren und somit blieb er ungeschützt und unsicher.Der Verlust des Moin Rescue Centers In 2013 wurden Pläne für einen kommerziellen Hafen gemacht, der dort gebaut warden sollte, wo sich das Rescue Center befand. Ein niederländisches Unternehmen, welches weltweit mehrere dieser Häfen besass, durfte das Projekt im December 2013 angehen, obwohl eine Umwelt Studie noch im Gange war.Das Unternehmen versuchte das Center zu überreden sich als Gesicht des Projekts darzustellen und leiteten die ersten Treffen ein. Sie machten leere Versprechungen über Verbesserungen des Centers, jedoch sind erneut wichtige Dokumente bei den Verhandlungen “verloren” gegangen. Als es dann endlich dazu kam, wurde die Firma von Mr. Chacon repräsentiert, welcher Biologe und gleichzeitig der ehemalige Boss von Jairo Sandoval war.  Er versicherte, dass die Bauarbeiten und die Errichtung des Hafens keine negativen Einflüsse auf die Umwelt und somit die gefährdeten Lederschildkröten habe.Da diese letzte Begutachtung im Stillen geschah, hatte die Firma das benötigte grüne Licht für die bevorstehende Konstruktion ihres Mega Hafens. Marielos und Bernals Bemühungen das Center zu retten, scheiterten.Als der Bau des Hafens in 2015 begann, wurde dies gross gefeiert und die Regierung gratulierte dem Unternehmen für den Kauf. Sara Chinchilla, die Leiterin des Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center, wurde von der Polizei aus den Feierlichkeiten enfernt. Die 10 Hektar Land auf dem Jairo ermordet wurde und die zugehörigen 40 Hektar Ozean wurden für den Bau des Hafens beschlagnahmt und eine 3 Kilometer lange Strasse wurde durch den biologischen Bereich gezogen.Im Januar 2015 wurde das Center schliesslich gezwungen die Fläche zu räumen, jedoch war Bernal nicht bereit das Center aufzugeben und engagierte einen Umwelt Anwalt, Mr. Rojas.  Dieser versuchte dem Center helfen und bestätigte ebenfalls, dass alle Vorgänge die zu gunsten des Hafens statt fanden, illegal waren. Nichtsdestotrotz kam am 4ten Februar 2015 die Nachricht, dass das Center innerhalb von 5 Tagen den Platz räumen, und damit 67 Tiere verlagern sollte. Doch dies schien unmöglich ohne Geld, ohne Laster und ohne einen Zufluchtsort. Die Firma drohte, dass falls das Center bis zum 9ten Februar nicht verschwunden sei, die Tiere beschlagnamt werden. Jedoch konnte Mr. Rojas eine Verlängerung von einem Monat rausschlagen. Dies ist der Tag an dem Moin weinte.In diesem einem Monat ordnete die Firma, mit Hilfe der Regierung, an die Bäume der Umgebung abzuholzen. 3 verschiedene Arten von Affen haben ihren Lebensraum verloren und die Geräusche der Kettensägen und anderer Maschinen erschütterte das Center. Darüber hinaus schoss ein vorbeifahrendes Auto mehrere Kugeln in das Haus von Mr. Rojas und Sarita Chinchilla wurde verfolgt und musste um ihr Leben bangen. Konservationisten kehrten ihr den Rücken zu, schrieben sie als mental krank ab auf Grund des enormen Drucks der auf ihr lastete. Dies war eine Lüge. Eine 4 Stunden Autofahrt entfernt, bot ein Tierarzt seine 12 Hektar Land dem Center für dessen Wiederaufbau an. Während der nächsten 3 Wochen fuhren die Laster pausenlos zwischen den zwei Orten hin und her, um die Tiere zu verlagern. Jedoch hatte die Reise und der Stress schreckliche Auswirkungen auf die Tiere. 14 Faultiere, 1 Eule und die einzigen übrig gebliebenen 2-Zehen Faultiere, die das Center hatte, starben. Nur die Motivation der Voluntäre hielt das Center am Leben. 2 Wochen nach dem Umzug halfen bereits 14 Voluntäre und im Juli waren es schon 38. Die heutige Situation und wie Sie helfen können Der Bau des Hafens ist immernoch im Gange. Um eine 2 Hektar Insel mitten im Ozean vor dem Hafen zu bauen wird nun auch noch ein Berg demoliert, obwohl der Umwelt in Moin schon mehr als genug geschadet worden ist. Es gibt bereits 2 Häfen an dieser Küste. Hätten diese nicht einfach verbessert werden sollen? Werden die anderen Häfen nun ihr Geschäft verlieren, damit die Firma die komplette Kontrolle errungen hat? Zurzeit mietet das Rescue Center eine kleine Fläche von 1,5 Hektar. Hier versucht es mit grossen Bemühungen einen stimulierenden und gemütlichen Lebensraum nicht nur für die Tiere, aber auch für die Arbeiter und Voluntäre zu schaffen. Die Gründer haben jedoch ein Grundstück von 4,5 Hektar Fläche gefunden, durch welches sogar ein Fluss fliesst, in dem es natürliche Frucht Bäume gibt und die Voluntäre und Arbeiter in besseren Konditionen leben könnten. Es gibt mehr Plätz für grössere und artgerechte Gehege für die Tiere in unserer Obhut. Unter anderem könnte ein Becken für Schildkröten Rehabilitation gebaut werden und ein Bereich in dem die Tiere zurück in die Natur entlassen werden. Dieses Grundstück ist nicht weit von unserem jetzigen Grundstück und es bieten bessere Lebensbedingungen für alle Parteien.  Jedoch fehlen für einen solchen dringend benötigten Umzug die finanziellen Mittel. Deshalb brauchen wir und die Tiere nun ihre Hilfe um Spenden zu sammeln für unser neues Grundstück! Wir bedanken uns aus tiefstem Herzen für Ihre Hilfe !  Egal wie gross oder klein Ihre Spende sein mag, wir schätzen sie sehr! Sie helfen uns die Zukunft des Rescue Centers zu sichern und somit auch die Tiere und die Umwelt zu schützen.","February 14, 2016","$6,972","$400,000 "
Megan Rutter ,"Canton, MN",Other,"Save the Planet… No. REALLY.
For those of you who don't know that what we're doing can actually save the planet, please watch this 4 minute award winning video from the 2013 MIT Climate CoLab Contest. It explains our work. http://tinyurl.com/l598yogThis is not some idea we just thought up. We have been working on this for 40 years. 40 YEARS of blood, sweat and tears. It WORKS.Forest and wild flowers now grow where there was corn. Birds nest. Frogs, butterflies, spiders, flying squirrels all make their homes in our crop fields. Water runs in our creek again. Children play safely in our fields. Horses and sheep peacefully graze. That is how we measure success on Badgersett. Join us. Be part of it.Those frogs now breed in our pond and hibernate in the chestnut forest that we have created.Those wild flowers, ones found only in the deep woods on state and national parks, grow freely in our fields where they feed butterflies and bees. Jack in the Pulpit, Mayapple, Violets, Jacob’s Ladder, Wild Geranium, Smooth Rose, Dutchman’s britches. They all grow in a field that produces as much food as corn and soy- because of the advanced crop genetics we have created.All this happened because we produce our crops with no spray. No chemicals. None. We handle our pests using whole ecosystem management. A crop system where there’s room for everyone, from the smallest mite to the coyote and hawk. Entire ecosystems exist here in a place that was once a corn and soybean desert. Because of us. Because of Badgersett.And with your help this system can be brought to other farms.We have developed these crops; new, advanced hybrid varieties of Hazelnut, Chestnut and Pecan that can grow and thrive in northern climates, over decades. They produce FOOD; oil, protein, complex carbohydrates . Enough food that they are competitive with annual agriculture. We’ve demonstrated it.Badgersett has been working for 40 years. Its founder, Philip Rutter, created the American Chestnut Foundation from a plan to breed trees like farmers profitably breed cattle, and an iron will to what is now a powerful 3 million dollar annual conservation organization. Everyone told him that it was a fool’s errand. Tilting at windmills. A dead horse. But Philip found the dreamers still willing to believe, and brought them together. Together they saved the tree, one all experts agreed couldn’t be saved.This is the determination that went into building Badgersett. It is a success story that we hope you will become a part of.We already have 100’s of growers across the US and Canada, who believe in us, and rely on us year after year. We have been there for them, but we need your help to continue to support them.We have partnered with universities across the US to fund crop development research. Our test planting at Oberlin College grew at an astounding rate and, as we have been promising, it produced nuts in 3.5 years. Those plants have borne heavier crops every year since. Our crops are not GMO.  They are simply hybrids of plants that have been separated since the continents drifted. By hybridizing them, we opened their potential in the same way our ancestors bred beans, squash and potatoes. That potential can in fact- feed the world.  It really could save the planet. Be a part of it.Our farm fossil fuel use has been cut by 90%. Let me repeat that… 90%. In 2011 we used 600 gallons of fuel to mow and plow. Then we got our horses, and soon there after we got the sheep. They now do work once done by machines. They graze, dropping manure that feed the trees and grass as they go. Which makes the grass greener, the trees bigger and more productive, and the animals fatter. The system nearly feeds itself now. In 2016 we bought 55 gallons of diesel. 600 gallons reduced to 55. That’s amazing in anyone’s book. Now Badgersett needs your help to continue. Climate change is happening faster than anyone imagined. In the last 3 years we have faced warmer fall and winter temperatures, making crop storage difficult. We have faced crop killing droughts followed by floods. And windstorms so severe that it was as if a hurricane hit Minnesota.  Our trees have survived this. We have survived this, but the damage and burden has slowed down our ability to continue our work.Our machines and buildings need repair. Our mortgage needs to be paid. And most of our funding sources have dried up, because face it, quietly working for decades doesn’t bring in the headlines. So we are looking to you; people who still believe in a better world to help move Badgersett forward so our successes can continue for the next 40 years and beyond. Please donate today. You will save the planet. Really.
Here, again is the link to our award winning video from the 2013 MIT Climate CoLab Contest. Please watch. http://tinyurl.com/l598yog*Who will benefit?The entire cosmos... (That is supposed to be humor, but true :-) )Hundreds of farmers across the United States and Canada who grow our plants, and rely on us to breed better plants for them year after year.Our workers and the work they do, improving our plants is so much less depressing than fixing something that broke for the 3rd time in a week. Trust me.The frogs, birds and butterflies, none of which can live in a cornfield.

Eilis Carpentier ,"North Island, Sunshine Coast, and Southern Gulf Islands , BC",Other,"I was arrested standing with the Tsleil Waututh and others on March 24 at the contested Kinder Morgan site on Burnaby Mountain. I, along with almost 200 others, have been charged with criminal contempt of court, and have had to find and retain my own lawyer. This GoFundMe campaign is to help me raise the necessary funds to pay my lawyer. (It's worth noting he is being very generous regarding his fee.) As these are criminal charges that may very well go to trial, this is not an endeavour I am able to undertake myself.These donations will help me immensely, and will ensure I have a defence as well as legal advice. I, like many defendants, do not have money for a lawyer but also do not qualify for Legal Aid. (Legal Aid levels have not risen since 1992, in terms of keeping pace with inflation and cost of living. BC's Legal Aid funding was cut by 40% in 2002.) These funds will go to my lawyer's fee and to attendant costs such as travel and fines directly related to my legal case. Anything I raise above my own needs will be donated to other defence funds for KM defendants.I went to Burnaby Mountain to protect my home, because I love it and I value it and it’s worth something to me. It has its flaws, and I have my issues with it. But I love it. Passionately and deeply. BC is a very special place. There is a reason why millions of people from all over the world want to come here, to visit and to live. We who do live here are so very lucky. At least, I feel lucky. And I believed, as I still do, that I had a moral obligation to make this effort, to take this stand.Some notes below re: my opposition, with links to insightful stories below them:Climate change:It's happening, and it will be catastrophic. The science on this is unequivocal and unforgiving. However, we still have a tiny, rapidly-closing window to mitigate some of the most cataclysmic effects. This pipeline and expansion of the tar sands will make such mitigation impossible. I'm a reality-based person, and there isn't a single credible scientist who supports the Orwellian assertion that by expanding the tar sands and pushing through this pipeline we can achieve our Paris commitments.(Below is a photo of the air in Gibsons last summer. Climate change is already costing BC enormously, in human and animal lives lost, and in billions of dollars.)Wildlife and endangered species:There are many marine species in BC who are at-risk and listed by DFO as threatened or endangered. The government has a legal obligation to protect such species under SARA (Species At Risk Act). These species will be put at greater risk and further endangerment by this project. The Southern Resident Killer Whales, an iconic BC species, are already on the brink of extinction due to human activities. These are extraordinary, complex, intelligent animals. This project, even without an accident, will in all likelihood end them. Vessel traffic disturbances, physical and acoustic, are one of the 3 root causes of their endangerment. This project will see a six-fold increase in tanker traffic through their habitat. (Below is a picture of part of their territory.)First Nations:Many First Nations, including those whose unceded territory this pipeline will go through, oppose KM. First Nations people and communities in this country were prohibited by law from hiring lawyers in the 50s, making it impossible for them to oppose the original Trans Mountain pipeline. The Tsleil Waututh and many other nations have now put cases before the courts (as have the province of BC and the cities of Burnaby, Vancouver, and Victoria). Those cases are not being heard, and will not be heard until it is too late. From my perspective, there’s little practical difference between making it illegal for people to hire lawyers and preventing them, once they’re can, from having their cases heard.https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf Economy:The tar sands in their entirety make up only around 2% of Canada's GDP yet this project could destroy BC’s economy. BC has a tourism industry worth more than $17 billion. Hundreds of thousands of jobs (that already exist) are dependent on it. A KM insider has gone on record saying this project will only create approximately 50 permanent jobs. The tar sands are a cautionary tale of the dangers of a monoculture economy rooted in a boom & bust model. The market for dilbit has been drying up for years, the price for it dropping for years. A massive tanker facility in Louisiana nullifies any economic argument for Vancouver as an export location. France and Britain plan to ban gas & diesel vehicles by 2040, Germany by 2030, the Netherlands by 2025. China has declared it will ban gas & diesel vehicles in the near future. The clock can't be turned back, and we shouldn't be trying.Alberta:We should be investing in Canada’s future, instead of Alberta’s past. AB has binged and squandered hundreds of billions of dollars of tar sands wealth. Norway, with $500 billion US less in oil & gas revenue than AB, now has a $1 trillion US sovereign wealth fund to transition their economy. AB has a $45 billion debt and a burgeoning deficit. AB refuses to do so much as impose a provincial sales tax to address decades of finanacial mismanagement, but demand we put our environment and economy at risk to benefit theirs.These are some links to stories and such that illuminate the issue far better than I possibly can:What the money being promised KM could go to Pipeline culture Trudeau lies Economic benefits to cutting fossil fuels What Canadian media isn't saying about First Nations resistance Facts with links Green economy offers 6 to 8 times more jobs than resource-basedThere's also a prescient document just released called Directly Affected. https://thetyee.ca/Culture/2018/04/20/Directly-Affected-Film-Madness-Trans-Mountain/","April 25, 2018","$1,966","$3,000 "

Kyle Lima ,"Welsh National Opera, Wales, United Kingdom","Creative Arts, Music & Film","￼￼￼￼￼Who I amMy name is Kyle Lima. I am an actor, writer and singer born and raised in Cardiff. I discovered my love for theatre and my passion for singing through my exceptionally inspiring drama teacher in high school who introduced me to the world of performing arts. She saw a talent in me for performing and encouraged me to pursue it.  I have worked with the Artistic director of the Bristol Old Vic and the visionary mind behind the world renowned production of 'War Horse', Tom Morris, in his BOV world tour production of A Mid Summer Nights Dream in which i played one of the young lover Demetrius. Most recently I have worked with the artistic director of the Shakespeare's Globe, Emma Rice, in her production of The Little Match Girl in The Sam Wanamaker Theatre at the Globe, as well as Emma's 'Kneehigh' production of 'Tristan & Ysulte' in which i played the scheming right hand man of the king, Frocin. Last year I was in Charlotte Churches 'The Last Mermaid as part of the Wales Millennium Centre's Festival of voice and my relationship with the WMC has continued in to a partnership on this project.Tristan & Yseult￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The Little Match Girl and Other Happier Tales￼￼￼￼￼Charlotte Church's The Last Mermaid ￼￼￼￼￼The Show: Heart and SoulHeart and Soul is a one man show about the great 'heart' and spirit of the Welsh, combined with the influential 'Soul' music, as well as other genres of music of the black culture. The Wales Millennium centre has been kind enough to offer to house the production but we are in need of funding to bring it to the stage.Heart and Soul is a show, celebrates the unique multicultural community of Cardiff, performed by myself portraying characters based on different generation of my family and the people of Cardiff. It will be a combination of historic and comedic stories inspired by different periods of my family and other members of the Cardiff communitie’s lives, interwoven with live music and songs of each characters heyday sung by me while accompanied on piano. The songs vary from Vocal-Jazz, classic soul, 90's RnB & Garage and perhaps a few other surprises too. It's a show set in three parts; the first of which I perform as a character based on my Grandfather who travelled the world in the merchant navy during the 30's and 40's, after leaving his home country of Cape Verde, off the west of Africa, and settled in Cardiff. The second part I perform as a character based on my dad and talk about him being a first generation black son born and raised in Cardiff and his experience of the night life in the 60's & 70's. I end of the show from my perspective as I little boy observing my much older brother, sister and there piers navigating the soul, RnB and Garage scene of the 90's. I sing songs from each era accompanied on piano by the accomplished RWCMD music graduate, Chris Hyson. Our dramaturge will be actor, director Anita Reynolds who directed the black writers collective show 'Sounds of colour' and who has just finished her terrific run in 'Hung' at The Other Room theatre.'Heart and Soul' talks about how unique a place Cardiff is and how ahead of its time it has been in regard to integration, interracial relationships and how influential music has been on the people and culture of the city. Benefit to the publicThis project will culminate in the presenting of a new cabaret/theatre show about different generations of people from the Tiger Bay, Butetown, Ely and Splott area. I want to make work which will shine a light on the communities within these places by using my family's personal stories, whilst proving that there is space for these communities to use theatre as a platform to represent themselves and tell their stories. In order to deliver a high quality show, I will be interviewing different generations of my family and the multicultural community of Cardiff to ensure I authentically represents accounts of Cardiff life. I want to make work which will shine a light on the community of Cardiff and places like it by using my family's personal stories through theatre to show a wider audience a reflection of their lives that they don't see often enough on the stage. Wales has a diverse population and as such theatre has a potentially diverse contemporary audience, however I believe that the theatre sector still has some way to go in order to represent this population. As a young man of mixed-ethic heritage from Splott, I think there is a lack of representation in theatre in Wales of individuals with my background as well as others of multicultural heritage. By supporting this project you would be providing the opportunity for people from a similar background as me, as well as all audience varieties, to watch high quality art which will entertain, enlighten and potentially inspire and encourage others to make their own theatrical work. I feel that there is a great need for a show like this given our current climate, where so much divisiveness is being seen in the media. What I will have achieved with Heart and Soul is to share and celebrating with an audience the grate example Cardiff has been in terms of unity between cultures. Cardiff is of course not perfect but the diverse people that inhabit it are all unified by one defining fact, that they can all proudly call themselves Welsh. My hope is to initially perform Heart and Soul in Cardiff and to eventually take it on tour around the UK and potentially further in order to share the great stories of Cardiff with as wide an audience as possible. AccessibilityI want to make the show as accessible as possible and with funding support I will make at least one performance both captioned for audiences with hearing impairments and audio described for audiences with visual impairments. The performance space at the WMC is completely accessible for those with physical disabilities.The production itself is in the English language as I am not a Welsh speaker; however with the help of the Wales Millennium Centre, I will ensure that all promotional material for the production will be bilingual so as to not exclude the Welsh language audience.

This would ensure that we can go ahead with the production and deliver the show to the best possible standard. Dramaturge - Anita Reynolds￼￼￼￼￼I trained as an actress at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and graduated in 1994. Although I am not originally from Wales, I have lived and worked in Cardiff for 27 years and proudly call Cardiff and Wales my home. Since graduating I have gained extensive knowledge and experience of the Acting and Theatre industry. Throughout my 23 years in the industry I have undertaken various roles.As an ActorI have performed in many productions on both Stage and Screen working with companies such as Theatr Iolo, Hijinx, London Bubble, Theatre Centre, Sherman and Shared Experience. I am currently working with The Other Room and RunAmok on their latest co-production of Debbie Tucker Green’s ‘hang’.My TV credits include Holby City, Casualty, Gwaith Cartref, Being Human and Stella.As a DirectorMy directorial experience involves mainly working with the BAME community.In 2010, I was commissioned by St Pauls Community Centre (Bristol) to devise and direct a theatre piece working with 20 young people of Afro-Caribbean heritage aged 14-18 years. Even though the piece was devised from issues affecting them and was explored dramatically using many improvisation techniques, the end result was a fully scripted play. The 12- week process culminated in a piece of theatre performed in both Bristol and Cardiff.Black History Month:On two occasions, I created with the BAME students at RWCMD a theatre piece celebrating race, gender and diversity.Sounds of Colour and Shades of Brown, although performed for different years, were similar in their mission. We wanted the opportunity to vocalise poems (published and personal), songs and excerpts from plays that catered to our diverse and ethnic needs. We wanted to hear ‘Our voices’ for a change on a stage in Cardiff. My job was to find the scripted material, to edit and formulate the content to produce an adhesive and dynamic piece of work.As a TutorOutreachIn 2003 the Royal Welsh college of Music and Drama asked me to write a report on widening access and raising aspirations, especially in relation to young people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. To garner the appropriate information, I visited and talked with many youth and creative organisations throughout South Wales and Bristol. My role was to seek out the external perception of the college, as viewed by these companies, and suggest ways in which the college could bridge the gap and develop collaborative relationships. One of the recommendations that highlighted in the report was a need for RWCMD to provide a drama outreach programme.So, before the Young Actors Studio (YAS) was established, it was my job to coordinate an outreach drama facility. My duties and responsibilities were workshop compositions (which were often bespoke), Schools liaison, budget allocation and building creative relationships with schools and community centres. This role I undertook for 5 years.As a RWCMD outreach tutor I have devised many successful short courses and bespoke workshops in subjects as diverse as communications skills for young Muslim women, confidence building for BAME young people dealing with Bullying to supporting workshop leaders in many educational settings.I am also a lecturer on the MA Musical Theatre course. Specialising in improvisation, my module focuses on becoming more present, interacting with spontaneity and exploring performance and text.As a FacilitatorIn my spare time, I help budding actors (on an individual basis) with their audition technique. During the sessions my role is director, facilitator, dramaturge and friend. The overall aim is to advance the acting process and presentation of the text detailing areas such as:• Character analysis• Exploring and Breaking down the script• Physicality• Authenticity of Character• Dissolving creative blockagesRE-LIVE Theatre CompanyNot all my experience is in relation to young people. Historically, I have worked with Re-Live Theatre company, empowering older people and carers to share their personal experiences of Dementia as a cathartic performance. Glyn Derw- Top up dramaTop up drama is a project that I set up as a freelancer with Glyn Derw/Michealston College drama department. The project gives extra curricula support to the Year 11 GCSE drama pupils from diverse and deprived backgrounds. The sessions focussed on creatively supporting the young people when working towards their practical exams. Most of the pupils had never seen a play or ever been to the theatre. Over the past 4 years of working with the School, I have used my knowledge of the industry and connections within Cardiff to help them fulfil their developmental needs with exam pass rates increasing year on year.Here are some of the things I have undertaken:• Locating new and contemporary scripts• Editing scripts• Directing the plays• Organising trips to watch plays• Arranging their exams to be held in a theatre with lights/sound!• Emotional support• Creative supportMusician - Chris Hyson￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼BiographyChris is a London based composer, producer and multi-instumentalist.

But it wasn't always this way...Born in Vancouver, she is a B.C. girl at heart. As a child she lived in Kitimat. Her father taught at Kildala Elementary School. Her family eventually moved to Kamloops where she finished high school at Westsyde Secondary. After a few years at community college and U.B.C., she went back east for a B.Sc. from McGill University. Her major was Nutrition. She also has a Masters of Science from l'Université of Montréal.During the 1990s, she worked for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on programs for maternal and infant nutrition in Guatemala (1990-1995) and Indonesia (1996-2000). She also did some food aid planning for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). Before that, she worked with Algonquin people to prevent diabetes in their communities in the north part of Quebec.During 2002 and 2003, she was Corporate Development Manager for North America for NUTRECO, one of the world's largest producers of farmed salmon and fish feed. In 2006, she prepared a submission to the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture of the B.C. Government. While preparing that submission, she unexpectedly came across a grant for an ""anti-farming campaign"" with ""science messages"" and ""earned media."" When she raised questions about this grant from the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation, four grants for a multi-million dollar campaign against salmon farming were quietly re-written by the Moore foundation. While going through the tax returns of American charitable foundations to try and figure out who was funding the campaign against salmon farming, she happened to notice many grants for a ""Tar Sands Campaign"". That's when she started to write about the campaign against Alberta oil.As she tried to take a look at the salmon farming controversy from a marketing perspective - a point of view that she missed when she worked in the industry - she wrote two papers about the so-called 'science' about PCBs in farmed salmon, and sea lice - and the money behind it.More recently, she has brought significant attention on how the Canadian energy industry is the target of a multi-million dollar campaign that explicitly aims to “land-lock” Canadian oil and gas, keeping Canada out of overseas markets. She also provides a practical, constructive roadmap for how industry can begin to deal with the activism that is targetted against it.","March 12, 2019","$8,700","$50,000 "

The plan is to help as many schools as we can within Montego Bay.  We  will be raising the money for school supplies  and issuing cheques so the schools may decide where the money is best needed.  Green Valley Wellness has always been and will always be a for the people brand and giving back to those in need is a great part of what we do and believe in. The raise will also go towards getting some staff there including a military veteran who volunteers with Green Valley Wellness. Our staff is what makes our business run and would love to give them the opportunity to help and be a part of this journey. We ask please to donate and make this happen for the children of Jamaica!Our timeline ends August 1st 2019!","May 13, 2019",$560,"$5,000 "
Darcy Vatamaniuck ,"Bienfait, SK","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","For every dollar we receive we will donate equivalent dollar value in donations of fresh fruit and vegetables to food banks in local communities where ever we build a greenhouse. Thank you for your help to make this project a success.In 2018 we begun building the first greenhouse in Bienfait, Saskatchewan Canada with the intention of supplying fresh fruit and vegetables to the local area. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate and between the heavy rains, and then the month without rain, the late spring and early frost things did not work out as planned. But having the extra year to plan I now have all confidence of success and regardless of weather the first greenhouse will be built by mid to late summer. Once food production begins, we will be producing fresh local fruit and vegetables. The greenhouses will be producing year-round and the intention is to sell produce to the local grocery stores and smaller convenience stores within a 100 km radius of the greenhouses for easier local access. In my area we have limited access to fresh local produce,(moldy strawberries, wilted greens and nutritionally deficient everything) and I am sure that my area is far better than a lot of other areas. With exception to the greenhouses in other locations located in Canada that produce the high value commodities such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and berries, the local farmers markets and home gardens most all our produce is imported. When I say limited access, what I mean limited access to fresh produce, most of the produce we find in our grocery stores has already spent at least a week in transit and once it arrives it has already lost half or more of the nutritional value. We are also opening ourselves to the potential of eating contaminated and chemical saturated foods that are not tracked in Canada until someone gets sick, our produce for the most part is coming from foreign countries that could potentially use chemicals not even legal in Canada, we need to bring our food production to the people in Canada. In our greenhouses we will not be using any pesticides or herbicides, and in the event, we find we have any food born contaminants they will be limited to the local area and will be substantially easier to mitigate the problem. This however is unlikely as we will not be handling the produce more than we must and we will be using the latest produce washing equipment and following the highest standards of food handling to reduce the risk to our customers of receiving contaminated produce. Most of our fresh food comes from outside of Canada from places like California, Mexico and beyond and is generally sprayed with pesticides, herbicides and others that I do not even want to know about. Canadians are far too reliant on foreign supplies of fresh produce. It is time we take control of our food supply and make it healthier, more accessible and ultimately this will make Canada stronger and healthier and more secure in the supply of fresh healthy food. Our future plans include bringing fresh food greenhouses to all corners of Canada. Once we have perfected the cold weather greenhouse design the first ones will be going to those most in need which are the prairie provinces and North to our third shore. Our biggest challenges will be money at the start, but once we get the first greenhouse built it is just replication and when we are in full swing there are no limits to our growth. As long as we have the Sun, water and the greenhouse we can grow anything anywhere. Eventually I hope to place a year-round greenhouse in every area that has 10,000 to 30,000 residents and in certain situations like in Northern Canada access to food is a very big problem which must be fixed. So, if you are interested in helping to build a more secure food chain in Canada and you have a few extra dollars to assist us, we will send you a packet of the seeds containing all varieties we will grow so you can grow your own garden at home. If you feel you can help in any other way that would expedite our growth, my phone is never too far away so give me a call if you have any further questions or suggestions. I would like to thank you for your donations and your time. Have a great day.","March 29, 2019",$5,"$1,000,000,000 "

Lynn Johnson ,"Oxbow, SK","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","""A PLACE FOR ALL"" and an  ""AMAZING PLACE"" it will be!!!This funding site is being updated as of today Wednesday, February 27, 2019 because I wish to broaden the scope of my call for funding. There is a Federal Election this fall in Canada. Due to this if I receive enough in donations to afford to, it is my every intention to run for member of parliament as an independent candidate.I have supported and voted for various parties provincially and federally in the past . All parties have their strong points, all parties have their frailties and short comings.I agree with Trudeau and the Liberals that a strong middle class is key to a strong stable economy, and I also agree that the Harper Conservatives were treacherous and divisive in their negative approach to politics and so I tend not to follow their example much. Rt. Hon. Joe Clark never became a Conservative but chose to remain a Progressive Conservative which I find to be a far more palatable political approach for conservative politics. Maxime Bernier has recently started a Conservative off shoot party called the People's Party which is a resurrection of the Progressive Conservative party. I may decide to align part of my independent platform with that of the People's Party over time as we find out more about them. I do contend that the presence of a progressive conservative party is a good thing to have in Canadian politics again. Welcome back Maxine Bernier et al.I also feel the Green Party has some relevant positions on environmental and social issues which bear consideration when running a country and deciding what's best. Their leader, Elizabeth May sets a very good example of a deliberate attempt in the over all picture of Canadian politics of a cooperative and constructive interaction with other parties and their affairs. She sets a good example of how politicians should attempt to interact on a day to day interparty basis.The NDP under Jack Layton were a party that championed the little guy, and the thought of inclusiveness and acceptance of others. For the most part that is a fairly good position to maintain. The NDP also has it's concerns with social programs and structure.Again they have their good points and their bad but definitely have issues, ideas and perspectives to be considered when running this country.You may want to know what my thoughts are on the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana last Oct. 17, 2018. Let's just say, ""If you can't keep off the grass, just mow the lawn when necessary."" LOLMedical marijuana has it's many merits and benefits and as far as what people choose to do is really their own business as long as there's no harm to others.So I want to run for Parliament this fall, so please help fund my campaign. I ran for Parliament in 1984 when I was 28 years old as a Rt. Hon. John Turner Liberal. He wasn't crazy about free trade and risking becoming an economic trading colony and economic puppet of the USA and neither was I.I was not successful in my efforts and withdrew my candidacy prior to the nomination meeting. This was so I wouldn't split the vote and risk having a more qualified candidate miss out and lose the nomination.It is over 30 years later and I feel qualified for this job now.So please read my entry in it's entirety, donate to my cause and vote for me this fall as an Independent candidate for Parliament. As a independent I can speak my mind, say the things that should be said, and not be muzzled to tow some misguided party line in some cases.So enjoy the rest of my entry. Donate to my campaign and cause, get in touch to volunteer to be part of the campaign team if you like and see you on the campaign trail. If I raise adequate enough funds to finance the campaign in time.Why should you donate? With the economy in our area as slow as it is as a result of the low price of oil if I am elected I'd have a job again and I would have a definite appreciation of it and would serve this constancy well and from a grassroots approach.I intend to represent the constituency of Qu’Appelle-Moose Mountain, with the position of taking what's best from all parties and what makes the most pragmatic sense, as opposed to being stuck with some old outdated party mantra or belief. I will represent the voices and concerns and best interests of my constituency first as apposed to towing some external party line interest. This I can do as an independent M.P.As far as political experience I have some to call on from my past and I've been governor of my own independent state of mind all my life. LolJoin the effort, join the campaign, volunteer if you like. The main priority is that we do some good as a result, enjoy the task at hand and of course have some constructive fun.So read the rest of my entry and find out who you might want to vote for this fall in the Federal election. Enjoy!Pre-Amble to the Main Entry called ""Amazing Place""The content in the main entry entitled ""Amazing Place"" may be in the eyes of many readers something that sounds far-fetched perhaps, maybe even something to read in a tongue-in-cheek frame of mind.""Amazing Place"" is about a regional real estate, spiritual, resort, entertainment, educational development concept that had been conceptualized close to 40 years ago. This concept had been put together by myself, Lynn Johnson, and a few key blue-chip developers. At the time of conception (the early 80's) Grant Devine was the Premier of the Province of Saskatchewan and his deputy premier was Eric Berntson. He was also the MLA for the Souris-Cannington constituency in the extreme S.E. corner of the province.It was the fifth year of their first term of mandate the P.C. gov't had to call an election in the spring of 1987. Some of these blue chip notables and some key P.C. members were lining up about $225 million in 1987 dollar value behind me to run against Eric Berntson.First, because they felt I had been well connected in my blue-chip careers thus far, that and as well, because they didn't want to vote for Eric Berntson again. Why? Recent to the impending election call Eric Berntson was in the news for alleged improprieties to his adopted teenage daughter. The next thing you know people are wanting me to run against him. But before we could get a campaign under way his adopted daughter gets thrown in a mental hospital and three of Eric Berntson's closest political associates trump up 3 criminal charges on me. As a matter of some incorrect paperwork and a paper-shuffle I was unable to defend myself and have the charges defended in court because before you knew it, I was thrown in a mental hospital too. Several years later I found out from a lawyer that there was a very notable misdelegation of due process that had me thrown in a mental hospital so I couldn't run against Eric Berntson.After his re-election and subsequent promotion to a federal Senator under their Rt.Hon. Brian Mulroney, he eventually had justice catch up with him hence he served time in jail on fraud charges to do with political pay-offs and influence-peddling and the like.Eris Berntson was known to be a crude, vulgar at times, populist bully who never was on the up and up.Back to my charges and the trip to the mental hospital I got railroaded and diagnosed as a schizophrenic by a doctor whose hospital was receiving millions of dollars as a result of Eric Berntson's gov't. Yes I was railroaded by a complicit psychiatrist who was part of Berntson's political takedown of me.I wasn't hearing voices and I hadn't ever been. That's part of a schizophrenic diagnoses. As well as not hearing voices I displayed none of the other characteristics that went along with the complicit and corrupt psychiatrist's diagnoses of me.After I got out of the hospital my phone had stopped ringing for my busy little business. The horrible medications they forced me to take for a gross misdiagnosis were debilitating and mental disorientating.As a result, instead of continuing on with a burgeoning and successful business and political career in my late 20's I got forced onto a disability pension and fell out of touch with my crowd of business associates.So ""Amazing Place"" and all the economic diversity that had been planned for S.E. Sask never happened because the people involved didn't want to have anything to do with Eric Berntson's vision for S.E. Sask. His view was to build up the oil industry at the benefit of his tight little club and everyone else go fend for themselves. A short-sighted view of a red-neck, bully, populist.In the years since 1987 when I was taken out, life has been a struggle because of the stigma attached of being a mentally ill person. A misdiagnosis if there ever was one. I have busied myself in the years since 1987 as a sales rep, a bit of consulting on business projects, public relations roles for numerous clients in recent years and doing carpentry and construction projects.But I never gave up on the hopes of making Amazing Place a reality someday.Political dirty tricks by Eric Berntson back in 1987 prevented it from happening back then. However Eric Berntson passed away on September 23, 2018 and now that his band of cronies no longer have a need to protect their beloved Eric anymore I'm putting forth this crowdfunding campaign again, called ""Amazing Place""I never had the chance to run for MLA in 1987 because of Eric Berntson's dirty tricks to protect against his alleged improprieties to his adopted daughter and numerous other things.So if anyone would like to see ""Amazing Place"" become a reality, if you would like to be part of a moment of letting the people in general decide as opposed to a corrupt few then please donate. There was international interest in the project and Berntson knew I would've beat him election day. Instead, he peddled influence, trumped up charges and had his daughter and then I systematically thrown in mental hospitals to cover up his dirty laundry.So if you want to be part of a grass roots movement, where you can be part of a movement and a project that is of benefit to everyone, not just an elitist few industrialist corporation's and individuals, then donate to ""Amazing Place""I'm looking for volunteers and manpower and when it's built it will be how the people want it done, at a grass roots level not just a vision of some select self-serving elitist few.Yes you will find things a little in question in the remainder of this entry called ""Amazing Place"" however I decided I would try for some controversy.For years I have lived under the restrictions of the mental health act and all the ridiculous red-tape of it all. A system where the professionals involved are bent on keeping patients rather than giving them a clean bill of health because that reduces their case-load which reduces their income. Yes a corrupt system, but I'll address that some other time.So being a resourceful sort and turning a negative into a positive for the benefit of everyone, here's what's going on in ""Amazing Place"".The system was bent on putting a ""mental"" diagnosis on me, when it was nothing more or less that a dirty political cover-up.Therefore if the system is bent on calling me crazy for the sake of their self-serving job security then lets work with that. Let's use it to our advantage as a drawing card and a curiosity item as you encourage others to visit this ""Amazing Place"" page.If there's going to be a ""mental"" aspect to it then do it to our advantage for the news worthiness and controversy.In the following pages there will be a rather glib but responsible claim to possibly being the second coming of Christ. I no more think that of myself than any other Christian.The second coming of Christ is the collective uplifting of love in everyone’s hearts. The definition of Christ is: the divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all mankind.There for no man or woman who has Christ in their heart is anymore or less important than the next or the other.So if you want to see ""Amazing Place"" built as it would've been some 35-40 years ago except for being stopped to protect a crooked and questionable political career, then donate.You’ll come to a sentence where it says I had a deadline to raise some $800,000 for the property. The deadline doesn't apply anymore. The land is being held for me.I'm looking for donations, investment and fundraisers. If anyone out there raises funds for me I'll give 10 -15% back to the fundraisers in commission.Be part of a grassroots movement where the people decide. Read and decide whether someone with a ""mental"" issue could've written ""Amazing Place"" or not. If you decide I deserve a chance to build the project then donate and bring others to the site as well. Perhaps we'll have a vital and viral campaign as our success.Eric Berntson died on Sept 23/2018. He put my life on hold in the spring of 1987 and cut short some life’s dreams of mine and others at that time. These many years later, I hope to build ""Amazing Place"" and make the economic development plan come about again for the people of S.E. Sask. There's more to building a economy than to focus on just resource based industry. There's trade, manufacturing, secondary education, entertainment, the arts and tourism a true diversity of potential that has been most sorrowfully ignored these last 40 years and are needed here more than ever. Needed to provide jobs so people have more of a choice for a livelihood other than moving away to a city and watch small-town Saskatchewan just get smaller.Donate to this movement.Donate to this cause.I've been capable of building this project for 35 - 40 years. Now it's time to get on with it.So now if you get on with reading ""Amazing Place"" and help in whatever way you can it will be greatly appreciated. Let's leave something to benefit people for generations to come. God BlessSo what do you think? Should we have an ""Amazing Place"" to benefit the world and a sustainable future, in a world of peace and peaceful coexistence.I think so. I've brought the idea up again after close to a 40 year delay. Let's get us back somewhat to a time and a world and headspace that wasn't bent on war and conflict but rather on hope and interactional development and cooperation.A time of Harmony, somewhat.Thank you for reading this.Thank you for realizing I can't do it by myself and donating to the cause.And without further adieu read my original entry entitled ""Amazing Place"" Enjoy!I open this funding page with a quote by Charles Herbert Spencer - 18th Century scientist and philosopher.""There is a principal in life which is a bar against all informationWhich can be used as proof against all argumentsAnd cannot fail to lead to a life of everlasting ignoranceThat principal is contempt, prior to investigation""As you read the rest of this funding request read it through to the end. At the end of it only determines whether you have contempt or consideration for it. Also at the end consider if there is value for the money from what you got out of it by reading it.Either in entertainment, intrigue, value or sense of purpose by donating. If you see a value gained then donate and fund this page accordingly.Hello! My name is Lynn & Thank you for coming to my crowd funding proposal called ""Amazing Place"", which is to be a real estate, cultural, educational, religious, recreational, entertainment and organic farm development.People want value for their money. That being said if you would like to base the size of your donation on value you get out of reading at this site, be it $2, $5, $10, or whatever amount, if nothing else base it on the worth value you get from the Poem that is written at the end of this entry. It is a poem of insight and unique perspective that allows one to feel right about oneself in their day-to-day. A reward to you for reading this entry in its entirety. So if Amazing Place gets the millions of dollars from this site at $2, or $10 or whatever at a time, then that will be the case and with the Peace of Mind that all donors got value for their money.That being said please also refer to the Glen Ewen General Store which gives a bit more on my background and related experience which leaves me capable of building ""Amazing Place""Why did I write this you may ask? After 62 yrs of living I just feel like having my say so and get some things off my mind. For those of you old enough to remember a well-known movie of the mid 70's called Network starring Peter Finch as Howard Beale. A news anchorman who was ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore"", that demonstrates the hidden mood of a lot of people again these days some 40 yrs later.So this is my once every 62 yrs vent of my feelings. By no means do I have any intentions of following in the footsteps of Howard Beale in the movie but by mentioning the movie, it does demonstrate some of my concerns and dissatisfactions with some aspects of the world as it is today. So therefore I propose Amazing Place as the project and solution to some of the needs this world has today and how we all can participate to be part of this project and social movement as the outcome. Please read on to the end. Remember there's a reward at the end if you do. And hopefully you will see the value for the money should you decide to contribute and participate in this project.As follows:My full name is Lionel Lynn Johnson. Born August 15th, 1955. Born in the middle of the night, middle of the month, middle of the decade, in the middle of the 20th century in the middle of the continent. I'm just a middle of road kind of guy.Middle of the road in the regard that you always have to evaluate both sides of an issue before drawing a sensible conclusion. And realize even after the point of conclusion there is still plenty of room for discussion. LOLAccording to history, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace died at the age of 33 and apparently there are clues in the Bible and from seers that 1988 was likely the year for his return to become King. August 15, my birthday was also the first day of Woodstock, the large peace festival which was held in the state of New York in 1969 which launched a great spin-off of peace initiatives in the world.Aside from being born on the same day as a day of Peace, August 15, my birth sign, Leo, is of a king, my first name, Lionel, is reference of a king, and my last name refers to a king. Johnson King John's son. Of course the King John who gave us the Magna Carta in 1215. The Initial Charter and start of Western Civilization and of the democracies we have in it's evolution.As well I am the man who would be king of one of the clans of this area. I was also 33 in 1988 when I was officially confirmed into the United Church of Canada as a member. I grew up in the United Church and upon leaving home at 18 for many years when not regularly attending church I lived the life of a gnostic. In simple terms the individual Christian voice. I kept the 10 commandments as my guide and reference as best I could and only focused on the Red Letter words of Christ in the Bible (KJV) as part of my sensibilities.In later years I attended the Anglican Church and now attend a private independent assembly of worshipers and believers. As a result of my association with the United and Anglican churches for many years I also support the Universal Catholic assembly. As a result of my coincidental entry back to organized religion at the age of 33 in 1988 as the seers said it might happen. I wish to make note I do support the Pope.In Matthew 24 of the Bible it is said that the coming of the Lord to take power would be accompanied by a streak of light in the sky from the east to the west and that no one would know of his time of coming but the Father, perhaps not even the man himself. In the spring 1996, the comet Hyakutaki crossed from east to west in the sky for the first time in recorded history. At the same time I took power over a major continental issue being the primary voice that stopped a large toxic-waste incineration project that would have poisoned millions of people, millions of acres of farmland and water supplies. Yes I was and still can be an environmental activist.In the spring of 1997, the comet Hale-Bopp came as a streak of light from east to west for the first time in recorded history. At the same time I took power back over my life and away from the authorities. This was necessary because in opposition to the toxic waste incineration project the authorities tried to punish me for protecting the earth and its inhabitants by trying to ruin my credibility by creating lies that had me put in a Mental Hospital. This was an attempt to get the incineration project back on board for the sake of money instead of common sense. A green peace executive told me during my stay in the mental hospital ""Don't worry. You can't consider yourself a true environmental activist until you've had at least one trip to the mental hospital"" Lol. They failed and I and the planet won because the waste incinerator project got cancelled.Now where am I going with all this is not to say or claim that I might be the Second coming of Christ. I make no claim on that. I'm just putting forth these circumstances and coincidences in my life to show why I live as just a man and I live simply as a reminder that we are to live in Peace and have no reservations in accepting Jesus Christ as my savior or as an influence in predicating my actions in life.Mathew 24 says no one would know of his time of coming. Perhaps not the man himself not anyone.The true definition of Christ does not refer to the human form. It refers to the ""divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all mankind. That being said, it is my contention that perhaps the second coming of Christ for mankind is the collective uplifting of love and peace through all mankind. With reference to the book of Revelation that ""nation rise up against nation"", why should it not be shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, not fist to fist.If in fact I am he, I will not and will never know it or believe it. All I will believe is that with all the acts of war and terrorism and social unrest and difference in the world that times are getting very uncertain. So much so that leaders are logisticizing and ramping up to a nuclear world war to end North Korea's war initiative. Another unfortunate case of the tail trying to wag the dog.So I say before it's possibly too late I'd like to do my part in starting a peace initiative that others might wish to take part in.How I am going to start it is by building a rural hotel, sanctuary, healing and family retreat complex. The first phase will cost $40,000,000As far as time frame, the first $800,000 must be raised by the first of June 2018 to secure the land, and to keep things on schedule.The next phase will be the building of the lodge, the combination concert hall, meeting, congregation, wedding and worship facility and the private cabins which will be situated around the central facility.Also there will be plans for riding stables and arena, an animal farm, trotting racetrack and stadium, golf course, and an organic farm corporation.The theme will be of a country retreat. Where people can listen to country and western performances and a traditional approach to life. There will be area farms participating, so that people can go out on hayrides, camp fires, ride a tractor or a combine and show the kids some of the rural life with bus tours and car rides in the country. That is of course when they aren't in the pool or on the water slides or being taken to the local skating rink in the winter.It will be a place where all are welcome and hosted for all their many needs. As far as the healing aspect people will be able to come for natural healing by qualified practitioners.For myself I provide products from: Anovite.com/superfood. Where you can find the #1 rated most nutritionally dense and complete food supplement on the planet. This ancient superfood has been known as ""the promise of life"" for centuries. This line of colostrum, corrects a condition in the body that is an affliction 85% of the population. When the affliction is corrected it provides all the building and constituents blocks and stem cell production for the body to correct and to help heal over 400 known autoimmune disorders. Be they mental, arthritis, MS, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, fatigue, stress, heart disease, blockages, cholesterol, fibromyalgia, weight control and much more.Scientific research concludes with the proper nutrition and environment a human should live to a 130 years of age and older. This product reverses aging and is the proper nutrition to extend a healthy life years beyond what one might expect.So there you have it. I want Peace and Peaceful Coexistence to come back to this world and my rural Hotel/Resort will be the model of this ""world community village we strived for after WW11. The war to end all wars supposedly. Now we've been ramping up since 9/11 and after 17 yrs of the struggle against terrorism it almost looks like the terrorist have already won by the turmoil the world is in. I want to build a sustainable meeting, holiday, healing center that is based on an old mantra of decades ago when I was young, an attempt to re-visit the "" world community village"" that my generation strived for in our youth.Unfortunately forces have taken the world away from that time and it's time to bring it back.You may think I'm crazy or eccentric at the very least but when you listen to some of our world leaders ramping up for world war and nuclear confrontation maybe we should all call for peace and do our part to participate in my particular supposed craziness.What if every person in the world decided to forgive and forget and woke up tomorrow in a non combative frame of mind. No need for war or terrorism and the world would be at Peace. It's as simple as everyone stop fighting and show tolerance for our differences not animosity. It's that simple. We could spend our time and money on technology to stop global warming and on green energy infrastructure and really save the planet.However if these are the times of the revelations, lets counter it by building a Peaceful getaway out here on the prairies. And when the 144,000 of the twelve tribes of Israel get done sorting it out in the middle east we can "" invite them all over to break bread on the patio at the hotel and encourage multicultural harmony not rivalry. Perhaps people will be dancing in the streets come that day.Who knows we get one working model going and then build more. This project will be totally off the grid with wind/solar power and hydrogen generator technology. At least we'll do our part for the planet though some world leaders turn a blind eye and refuse to their part.Should you decide to help fund me, I accept it with gratitude, humility and should you come see the place some day you will be greeted, welcomed with respect and dignity. Should you decide not to help out that's ok but please do me the favor of referring others to this page and help get the word around.Recommended reading:The Celestine Prophecy - James RedfieldA Return to Love - Marianne WilliamsonBringers of the Dawn - Barbara Marciniak7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen J Covey""Imagine all the people, living life in Peace.You may say I a dreamerBut I'm not the only one.""John Lennon - The BeatlesGo in Peace Harm No One- Jesus ChristSo folks let's have a bit of fun doing this. When a person takes themselves too seriously that's when problems arise.If 10% of the Christians on the continent of North America all gave me $1.75 each I reach more than my total of $45,000,000. And if you all shared this on Facebook it could happen.If those of you who wished to participate in this project have no congregation that you attend on Sunday, perhaps you might come to this site and make a regular Sunday by Sunday donation in absence of supporting a congregation. Support the ""Amazing Place""A place built on the principles of peace, world community village, equality, and harmony.Once it is built this place of sanctuary and harmony it will embed into the rest of the world a living mantra to hopefully send it. A middle of the road kind of guy who has a sense of humor and just wants the world to lighten up a little. God knows its needed. That's why he told me to say so. Nudge nudge wink wink. My lawyers, Accountants, Architect and the like are in place and a very large hotel chain interest is in the background. Having said that the general over all theme of this development will be an attempt in appearance, character, personality of the late 50's to the late 60's. It was post war the world was relatively at peace and it was a time when the people and the land were relatively in harmony and everybody had hopes and dreams and expectations for the future. We had a strong growing middle class there was always enough to go around and people still made a point of making sure everyone was helped out. Things were still pretty traditional. Music and architecture and home life not unlike the old classic movies. There was a mood of tolerance benevolence and inspiration towards life and progress in general. People felt safe and secure whether it was with their neighbor next door or family or a stranger they met on the street. This is what we wish to embody in this development and attitude towards achieving the end goal and presentation of ""Amazing Place"".We may be able to promote other developers to join in and build something not unlike a small scaled down Branson, MissouriThe sky is the limit. It all starts with an idea.""Build it and they will come""- Field of DreamsSome might be curious about this following point about me. I live as a celibate heterosexual. Decades ago I could have said a gentleman but today no one would get it anymore and I believe that sexual intimacy and love making be between a man and a woman within the institution of marriage. It has been God's wish that marriage is between a man and a woman. Those that would want to change that to include homosexuals are going against God's wish and allowing the tail to wag the dog. Too much of that these days. Homosexuals can have recognized civil unions and be accepted as Christians but I don't approve or recognize an act of marriage between them. It's against God's wish.If you give a donation or not here's an insight that is priceless.How to acquire Peace of mind and feel God's Love:Sit back relax, a few deep breaths then passively and acceptingly feel the emotion of something loving and something beautiful and put those two feelings together.Example:A memory from your youth of being with friends or family and seeing the presents under a beautiful Christmas tree on Christmas morning. At the instant you combine the emotions of love, peace and beauty you will feel a Peace of Mind.If it's a surprise to you when the peaceful sensation happens don't become aggressive towards it because the feeling disappears. You must remain passive and patiently accepting for the feeling of Peace to stay. It takes practice to master it so you can have Peace of Mind all the time.Another insight:Reality is one extreme or the other or somewhere in between. Up or down, happy or sad, good or evil, giving or taking, selfish or generous, stoic or arrogant and so on.Basic psychology only has 2 emotions Love or Fear, or rather Love going the opposite way.So a person goes to or from something in love or feel or neutrality or indifference.From these basics and predicated by the 10 commandments in interpretation a person can figure out or determine what's up or what's best about just about anything and if uncertain about the choice of actions you can use this basic system to figure things out. So with reality as between 2 extremes and with 2 basic emotions how do we exist, within that binary system.I choose to live moving forward, spiritually upward in a caring , considerate, productive and benevolent and helpful regard. All in an effort of achieving Peaceful positive synergy and harmony with the world and people around me. I feel resolved and confident in this state.My politics are similar to my driving habits. I stay close to the middle of the road but a bit off to the right (right minded as opposed to right wing) and some times I use the left lane to bypass some obstacle on the right that slows me down or makes good sense to do so. And I do contend that if you get too far to either side of the road you'll end up stuck in the ditch going no where in a hurry.It's always a case of staying centered and balanced in your determinations of what is truth and what is just and right.""Everything that exists is real""""Anything that is real need not feel fear""""There in lies the Peace of God""From the bookA course in MiraclesI might add to that ""If you feel fear where you're at then where you're at isn't real""""So move in mind or place to a place that gives you Peace.""I'm putting out a call particularly to the baby boomers to help me. Act now and join the cause so we don't become a wasted, forgotten, ineffective and insignificant generation for what we once all believed in like peaceful coexistence may all be lost if we don't remind the world again what our generation stood for or all may be lost. I think otherwise. That's why I want to make this project and frame of mind amongst all people Hopefully you do too. Let's make the difference we are supposed too. So again thank you for your time reading this and again ""Go in Peace, Harm No One""Jesus Christ""Live Long and Prosper""SpockIt maybe the devil or it may be the LordBut you're going to have to serve somebodyBob DylanI choose to serve the Lord.And yes I may be psychic because: ""I can tell by the way you're thinking about me that you don't know whether I'm the real thing or not"" LOLIf I am all I can say is I sure wish they had twin blade razors back 2000 yr ago.""Hope is the greatest antidote for fear""Let us all hope for Peace Everlasting and a sensible outcome in the affairs of this chaotic world. To all you baby boomers out there, we grew up as the generation of Peace and Love"". Let's all live it.Be the change you want to see in the world today.Mahatma GhandiThank you for getting through my some what elongated. Slip of the mind. LOLI do have the practical life expression as to make ""Amazing Place"" a reality and in the midst of all of it keep it fun, and inspirational for everyone. We take the project seriously but not too serious within the project.When you get too serious about anything it takes the versatility of the mind and the heart away to stay inspired and fulfilled in doing a good and beneficial job of anything. That being said, spread the word, create some controversy over this great mystery at hand. Will ""Amazing Place"" come to be ? Always the conundrum. Maybe this sounds a bit off beat or as a departure from the popular approach of divide and conquer, choose up sides, exploit and capitalize that goes on with others these days.Hopefully cool heads will prevail and this Amazing Place will be built in recognition that working and coming together can work instead of divide and conquer.Amazing Place, taking us back to where we should not have left bringing us in to the future with a sustainable followable path. Let's see this place built to show that nice people and their efforts don't have to necessarily finish last.""A hotel, sanctuary, healing, entertainment, vacation, sports, equestrian, place of gathering and worship. Built on the premise of equality, world community, village, love, peace, benevolence and an effort of bringing people together, not by dividing and conquering as some hotel operators would do out there, amongst other things. This project will be a success built on bringing people peacefully together, in the common good, not dividing, conquering and chaos. There will be something for everyone and at an affordable admission price.Now that we're close to the end of this account of request for help in the way of money and as to why, let me state the following:I don't really need 10's of millions to make Amazing Place become a reality. I really only need perhaps 3 million dollars. Enough to purchase the required land and the balance to promote, get marketing and design the concept and then leverage the balance of the money with in visitors participating in the long run. If the money fund raised is in an amount that exceeds the initial 3 million dollars then farm land shall be purchased to start an organic farm corporation to help feed the guests and the world in general. With decent edible food instead of the over processed, chemically doctored food we are almost obligated and forced to eat today for lack of other choice. And as far as me being the second coming, please don't take me too seriously, but take the concept of peaceful coexistence and love amongst man and woman kind is what is intended as the outcome put into the present once Amazing Place is built.Take the project seriously but don't get carried away with too much else.It's all in the name of having some hope having some fun and controversy and goodwill amongst all men as the outcome.Let Amazing Place, it's intent and process be the quantum shift the world needs.A project of bringing the world together in Peace with a common belief in harmony as opposed to the present state of divide and conquer, chaos and threat of nuclear confrontation.Let us all be light hearted and hopeful that Amazing Place soon becomes a reality. Nothing but good will be the outcome of our actions on building ""Amazing Place""Let us all enjoy the task at hand of making it happen. If any opposition to the project or myself arises go tell someone else...After all I'm a lover not a fighter. lolThank you and may you and your future be blessed.Everyone now go and figure. Always the Conundrum lolSo there we have it folks. A proposal to build a project called ""Amazing Place"". To be built for a gathering place for people in the event that a place is required for the Second Coming of Christ to participate.Again I am not claiming to be the 2nd Coming only that I have had coincidences in my life that make others and myself casually quires at the possibility. So if I am not he, and he does show up we'll have a place for him. As well I am not a false prophet for I make no prophecies to speak of. Only that the Second Coming of Christ, yes Christ, by definition the light of Divine Love that is thread through all of us, be apparent, abundant and necessary for the return of Christ to Earth.So why do I attempt to make Amazing Place a reality? I refer to a popular remark of Dr. Wayne Dyer (well-known spiritualist and author) who says,""Don't die with the music still inside of you""Amazing Place will be my version of a harmonious job site and project for the heart and soul. A composition, bricks, mortar, healthy organic farmland, hotels, concert and congregation halls, recreation, education, healing and culture all done in cooperative concert with nothing but good but to come of it.That being said let us refer to the lyrics of a fitting song that suits my mood, my sense of humor and in some sense the mental space of many of the baby boomers o my generation. He's an Old Hippieby the Bellany BrothersLet's make Amazing Place a reality. If for no other reason than it will give us a fun project to work on for the next many years and keep life interesting. One more song lyric to keep in mind Don't worry be happyby Bobby McferronIf they make this into a movie some day, ""I hope it's a comedy"" lol Now here is The Poem I promised to you at the top of the page. A little reward for completing you task a job well done.- ""The Man Without Money (or) Don't Let The Joke Be On You""The man without money is not the man who is broke.Not like the man who can't laugh at a well-meaning joke.People will eat and people will drink and people will eat, drink, and smoke.And some will even deprive or indulge until they nearly choke.Others might lie, cheat, steal, confront or deliberately provoke.Looking to answer the questions that life will invoke.I think here is truth in these words which are spoke.It is always best to focus one's own personal God-given talents.On that which gives life timing, truth, honor, coordination, just cause, just intent, harmony and balance.So please realize there's nothing that badly broke.If you can still laugh at a well-meaning joke.And should you deal fairly, deal honestly with people, not with bullish tactics and greed.The reputation that comes to precede you will be your true fortune indeed.Believe in these words, belief in them is a must.For it gives you a place and a focus that is just, that others will trust.And you'll find you never feel that you will ever lose face.A you walk on through life in a state of Peace, and a state of Dignity and Grace.So please realize there's nothing anywhere near broke.If you can still laugh at a well-meaning joke.Should you try the thought of these lines if only for the heck of it.You'll find you never have to live in spiritual deficit.And for those who don't believe these lines to be possibly true.I tell you my friend the joke is most certain on them not on me, not on you.The EndSo there we have it folks. Value for the money. Donate whatever you deem the value of the poem. Focused and Fine. ""Five bucks for a fine and feisty frame of feeling"", perhaps? lol Or the value of the dream of a place of peace and amazement and being part of helping in the building of ""Amazing Place"". At attempt to bring peace to the world and resolve conflict. All money received is received with humble appreciation, respect and utmost state of responsibility and determination and dedication to get the project done. It will be built by benevolence and goodwill, and so shall it exist and operate in many regards once built.Why will it be an ""Amazing Place""? It will, because of amazing and abundant response to this project that it will help create jobs, heal people, heal the land, give the contributing people of the world something to take part in. A real cause.Everlasting peace and harmony amongst the people of the world. And a sustainable planet, environment, ecosystem, and political climate. Yes an Amazing Project, Place and Movement.""Amazing Place""Achievable conceivable $2, $5, $10 at a time. Make a game of how many you can bring to the site. Maybe the $40 million will be here by summer next summer or several summers after that. You never know. We'll just make it a pet project of ours to save the planet. No matter how long it takes. Let us all ""rise to the mountain tops to see the Promise Land"" - paraphrase of Dr. Martin Luther King.Maybe you should leave a couple of bucks behind just in case I might be the second coming. I can use it for getting rid of the possible bad issues and bad guys that might come to be or in fact might already be. Refer to Revelations in the bible.The anti Christ has the number 666 associated with him. The address 555 - 5th Ave NY, NY belongs to a building owned by a well known billionaire. ( go out and google to see who it is) On one floor of that building is a company called Lucifer Technologies. They are the developers of micro-chip technologies that are already being put in humans for identification purposes in some companies. Bearing the mark of the Beast of the earth so to speak.There's a large banking computer in Brussels, Belgium that apparently has been accumulating and recording everyone in the world banking system and giving them a number. A triple six digit coding system is at the bottom of it. This computer is speculated to be the Beast of the Earth by some. Intended to take away a person's independence's, rights and freedoms in so many ways. With a few of these apparencies one can only speculate as to the implications or the outcome. One can only wonder.I draw no conclusions other than to be wary of these present day activities and to make my efforts as best I can to help the planet through these unsettled times and to work for the best outcome and resolve for as many as possible. I draw no conclusions on the afore mentioned people or places perhaps. Judge not lest you be judged.So if you'd like to help me out, just in case, your contribution will be appreciated in the utmost.Am I the Second Coming. Who knows for sure. No one ever will probably. All I can say is why did God lead me to notice the coincidences in my life that lead me and others to wonder if I really might be.Go figure.I wish no one any harm, and one purpose of mine is to appeal to the U.S. and N. Korea to de-escalate their confrontation.Ramped up much further and everyone on the planet is a loser in some regard as a result of what could transpire.An old 1960's montra went as follows:Make Love Not War. So since 9/11 it has been ramping up with more and more rivalries, conflicts and animosities in the world than ever before.Remember the rather hopeful calm and progressive confidence there was in the world and a general state of over all well-being before 9/11.All I can ask now is whatever happened to Make Love Not War?People, people, people, where is the love that once was?People, people, people, where is the love.Remember in order to save the world it has to be a group effort. Everyone sharing in the satisfaction of doing something worth while. There may be a very significant need for a world effort for peace and a disarming of minds and battlefields. If you are going to donate I will close with this poem called."" The joke is on You"" or ""The Man Without Money"" as you prefer. If after hearing/reading it  gives you a sense that everyone is ok in the thought and it's a good way to lift the spirits. Then give this project what you think the poem is worth. How about Five Bucks For The Feel Good Factor. lolHelp save the world for $5. The outcome of doing so will be heavenly.This may come as madcap or tongue in cheek reading to you in some regard. I try to keep it lighthearted and humorous but only to be good medicine to the mind. But please be rest assured any donation received and no matter how many millions raised or other assistance provided it will be received with the utmost of respect, humility, care, responsibility and conscientiousness. So thank you ahead of time.Lynn Johnson just a middle of the road regular kind of guy who wants to do something meaningful for the world. In the words of a Paul Simon song ""Don't want to end up a cartoon in a cartoon graveyard""""Peace"" is the theme of this year's Winter Olympics on at this time. Valentine's Day is near so I thought I'd release this to coincide with a time of Love and Peace in the world. As an attempt to bring back even more love and peace to the world and in the years to come. For the love of the planet, the people and all creation.We are all custodians of this planet. Let's take collectively better care of it than we have of late, environmentally, socially, politically. People! People! People!Where is the Peace we all once knew? Especially before 9/11Let us recover and recapture and contribute the missing peace in the building of Amazing PlaceAs for myself I am a low key ,retiring sort who lives a basic, practical life on a small gov't pension, an occasional commissioned sale of green energy with a wind turbine company at www.kelsoenergy.com , some odd jobs and the occasional bit of design and reno carpentry projects. I also buy and sell a bit of used practical and collectible goods I seem to get by and the money that I make helps to look after my 87 year old mother and others that I give help to when I have the change to spare.I guess that's why I have to ask the world to help me in this campaign for mine was spent helping others already. I ask the world for its help so that I can repay the world back by helping reestablish a place in it of peace and love that shall spread through out the world for the day to arrive of everlasting peace.I am not an extravagant or wasteful man and I consider myself quite practical most of the time and that is how I will deal with all funds raised for Amazing Place.So please contribute to this cause, this movement. Ask others to come to this site and do likewise. Make a difference.Nothing ventured, Nothing gained! Let's attempt to make this site experience visitors in a viral, spiral. lol No I'm not crazy and I haven't slipped a gear. It's just a case that the older one gets the more they tend to speak what's on their mind and in their heart than what you think the world expects of you. I guess that's true in my case.Besides i was curious what would come of it if I did do as I have just done , namely releasing this campaign called""Amazing Place"" That and the need to keep life hopeful and interesting for as many as possible.Join the cause and the movement, make a difference, and at least say you tried and gave it an honest attempt Nothing ventured, Nothing gained.If nothing else I hope I have given you food for thought. I hope that they're heavenly thoughts. LOLAnd have a happy and abundant life.I don't ask in you giving a donation that you choose to believe in me as the second coming. I ask you to donate in your belief in God, in love, in peace, good will toward your fellow man and respect for the creatures and all life on the planet.Amazing Place will come to be, not for me, but for everyone who believes in Christ, in the Divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all God's creation.Amazing Place and this planet will be for everyone who comes in Peace and God's love which is Christ. All contributions to this project are to be administrated by a Christian Organization in background. This organization exists as a independent congregation and benevolent charitable organization and is registered as such with gov't and CRA. Conducting activities such as Amazing Place is just one of it's projects.So give and be a part of ""Amazing Place"", a part of something bigger than us all, a ""movement"" refreshed and renewed in the direction of ""Everlasting World Peace"". We've been a state of escalating conflict and war in the world since 911.Let's face it world leadership in many regards has become  ""bunker-lunky"".We need a quantum shift and a focused shift to world peace.Sign on with Amazing Place and make it a notable part of the world movement for Peace and World Community village. Sign on. You have to believe in and stand for something or you will fall for anything. Believe in and stand for Christ and Peace and in Amazing Place to be that vehicle. Believe and act or react upon this moment to make it happen and thanks for your time and donation to help spread the word and make Amazing Place and all it stands for a reality. Thank you.So now that you have read the entire entry do you see any value to it? If so, donate and fund accordingly and spread the word.If you take contempt that I might be the second coming. That the ominous consideration of the book of Revelations might well be right. That might be a just reaction. No one wants those occurrences to come about.I am simply hopefully that some of the spiritual sources I have been in touch with those seers claiming that the real second coming of Christ is not for another 3200 years or so. That there are powers and influences on this planet that are trying to concoct a false state of Revelations of this time of man that will be false Revelations, but destructive and tumultuous to man and the planet nonetheless I'm just trying to diffuse the situation as gently and tactfully as I only remain hopeful that the pendulum of war, chaos and conflict that is upon this world and I'm calling upon the help of others the help of the planet would be nice.

Ben Armstrong ,"Calgary, AB",Business & Entrepreneurs,"Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to spend some time on a houseboat near Sicamous  B.C.  during my time on that boat , I was part a conversation where I learned of a weather event that wiped out an entire house boating company, many of their boats and buildings  on the property. the company , waterways houseboats had 9 of their own boats , and 50+ houseboats that belonged to individual investors. after the weather event, the fleet of investor boats were dispersed to other marinas where they were stored and no longer generating revenue, but incurring   mooring and storage fees. this is not the main story here , it is only one part of a very large problem.the staff of almost 60 lost their jobs this past June as waterways was never able to recover from the devastation of the storm. and yet, this is also not the main part of this story either.as I listened and participated in this conversation I was made aware of the environmental impact that these large boats were having on the lakes . these boats vent their exhaust gases into the water through a passage in the middle of the props. it is not just the large house boats, even the smallest 2 person fishing boats also vent exhaust in this manor. when these gas powered engines leak oil, it is directed right into the water, when fuel leaks , and it often does... it goes into the water. when giant storms hit the boats and marinas , the floating fuel stations can and have ruptured into the waters and partially submerged boats will also release fuels and oils into the lakes. I thought well thats only a once in a decade event ,it cant be that bad.....I  Was so terribly wrong, that night as we slept, partially beached on a sheltered shoreline , a large storm blew in. our boat was ok in the morning, but when we entered the large portion of the lakes all  we could see for 30 kms were boats smashed against the shore, many disabled houseboats taking on water  and countless tow boats rescuing  boaters. when we entered the marina , a man working  on the docks greeted us and asked if we took any damage, when we told him we were OK, he told us that 34 house boats had wrecked in that arm of the lake alone and countless other vessels.I was astonished, I could see the oil and fuel slicks spreading through the lake surface for the whole 30 km trip.Immediately , I knew what had to happen. I knew I had to find a cleaner solution for this industry. and thats exactly what I did!I borrowed a page out of Elon Musks mission statement to provide green transportation to the waterways of the world. I'm currently working on the development  and implementation of electric drive commercial watercraft. I have spoken with local city council members and have received their interest for support and encouragement. i have interviewed multiple watercraft owners and received their excitement and willingness to convert to electric drive if such an affordable product was available. I took my interviews to the coast of B.C. and spoke with boat dealership, owners , small commercial water craft as well as large commercial watercraft owners. over 90% of the people i spoke to said they are just waiting for the day the can trade their petrol burners for electric power plants.have you ever watched the water at the back of a boat? as the props churn the water up theres a yellowish and sometimes brown discoloration in the white froth of the water, thats toxic deadly exhaust gases mixing into the water , causing it to change its composition slightly and making it more acidic. and boats have been doing this by the hundreds of thousands for the better part of the century just in and around B.C.  imagine how bad that is across the world.I'm asking for financial support so I can work with a supplier to acquire and build the technology into watercraft, starting in the Schuschwap lakes region of B.C. Canada. The funds will also go towards acquiring a facility with the support of local government. I fully intend on providing stable employment year round starting with the waterways staff who lost their jobs , as well as reviving the investment properties by converting them to electric and rebuilding the former waterways fleet into the worlds first full electric houseboat rental company. i believe that the local competitors in the house boat industry  will have to also convert to electric in order to be able to compete with the cheaper to operate electrical units. It is also my belief that tour companies , and smaller watercraft businesses such as water taxi will also make the change to electric within only a few short years. originally i had hoped to raise enough money to revive waterways house boating , and establish the change to electric after the fact. but nov 20 2019 is the deadline to buy the company and its property and assets , and there is just not enough time to raise the 8.8 million required to do so. if by some miracle there is enough donations , i will put it towards reviving the company and its fleet. I would then use government green grants and local government support to realize the implementation of electric drive  watercraft with units ready for the 2020 spring starting what i can only see as a revolution in watercraft propulsion.  this is not a fundraiser to just change watercraft in this region. I have contacted Elon Musk , inviting him to bring in his technology and finances to this venture to ensure it is available to the entire  world as soon as possible.a little about myself, I'm a licensed tradesman . I hold three journeyman redseal certifications mainly as heavy duty technician, and have worked in that capacity for 20 years. in my 20s i developed and engineering company where I custom designed engine components and built custom vehicles. at my peak success from my home my company was selling almost $1,000,000/ per year . The hit to the economy in 2008 forced me to make a choice to go for the money and work myself to the bone to get through the recession, or to slow down and start a family, since I've never really cared to live beyond a simple humble life , I decided to put my company to sleep  and raise a young family, now that my children are older I felt it was time to bring a company to life and build something for my children so they could continue to make this world a better place long after I'm gone.I will provide updates, regardless of donations. i'm using what little money I have access to as i have been off work fighting a minor bout with cancer of which I am recovering. I'm not above selling my car or truck and every time I sell something Ill post how much of those proceeds have gone towards this endeavor. I'll post which grants i have applied for and how much and so on and so forth.I thank you in advance and hope you share my enthusiasm for how we are going to impact the lives of many , the environment and the future!","November 15, 2019",0,"$167,500 goal"
All Nations Relations ,"Portage La Prairie, MB",Business & Entrepreneurs,"EXPERTS SAY WE ARE 10 YEARS AWAY FROM IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO OUR PLANET...AND THAT IF WE DO NOT ACT NOW IT WILL BE TOO LATE.Whether you believe we are 10 years away from irreversible harm to our planet or not, most can agree something needs to be done. Things need to change for the better. The way we have done things in the past needs to change in order to make a real positive impact on our planet's health.Our ultimate goal... To make the world a better place. To make the world a healthier place. To help those people trapped in low-income lifestyles and those living in ""Food Deserts"" get access to healthy, organic, and affordable foods.  Our project intends to change the way foods are produced, traded, and consumed, thereby creating Food Sovereignty for impoverished communities all over the world. We are able to produce healthy organic foods with higher production yields and lower operating costs utilizing our self-sustaining and renewable, clean, green, energy generation and organic plant fertilization. The best part...NO HARMFUL EMISSIONS, CHEMICALS, FERTILIZERS, OR PRESERVATIVES that damage our bodies and our planet.Welcome to the Sustainable, Renewable, Clean, Green, Healthy, concept of EDEN LODGE...The next evolution in the Farm-to-Table movement.We have spent the last three years dedicating ourselves to a design and concept that would not only produce fresh fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins in low-income food desert areas year-round but would also produce them at extremely low costs, thus allowing healthier organic foods to become a viable FIRST choice food selection rather than the LAST choice. HEALTHY BODY +  HEALTHY MIND +  HEALTHY FUTURE =  HEALTHY PLANETOur first goal is to create a massive reduction in health-related diseases in these communities. Diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes, Heart Disease, and chronic adult and child obesity due to the high consumption of processed foods. From this, we feel we will be able to start with a HEALTHY BODY.Our secondary goal is to build Eden Lodges in areas that are currently not economically able to support a large workforce or are not in ideal situations due to lack of proper transportation or personal income. Eden Lodge would create viable economic and employment opportunities for communities in these areas; opportunities that would lend to the growth and prosperity of these communities and the families that live in them.  This we feel will start to build a HEALTHY MIND.Our third goal is to create long-term, full-time employment opportunities. Part of this goal is to provide training and peace of mind to potential workers in these communities by empowering them with the skills and knowledge needed to not only successfully operate their own community Eden Lodge but to also work as a CO-OP in shaping their local economic future. By producing healthier foods at a lower cost we hope to increase the amount of discretionary income for low-income families, income that could be used to purchase other life necessities that often don't make the family monthly budget. This we feel will start to build a HEALTHY FUTURE.Our overall goal is our most important goal of all.  Creating a better planet. Leaving the world a better place than when we found it. In achieving our first three goals we will be able to create environments that are filled with quality nutrition,  positive economic growth, and a future filled with hope for the people and communities that are struggling with the lack of affordable healthy foods. All of this can be achieved and It can be achieved with a near-zero carbon footprint. It can be achieved without the use of harmful pesticides, chemicals, fertilizers, AND greenhouse gas emissions. It is not ""the"" solution but rather ""a"" solution to building a HEALTHY PLANET. HEALTHY PLANET, HEALTHY PEOPLE ...NOT PROFITS. A little background about us. We are not wealthy. If we were, we would fund our project ourselves. That is how important this is to us.  We are simply two individuals that have invested their own time and their own money into creating something that can make a difference. Something that will improve people's lives and the health of our precious planet. Something that will become a ""game-changer"" in the way healthy foods are produced, traded and consumed. Something that will create Food Sovereignty in impoverished communities within our country and the rest of the world. Something that is GOOD FOR THE PLANET. We have a viable idea but we need your help!100% of funds raised will be used for our start-up location in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  Funds will be used for equipment, building lease, and standard operating expenses.  Our wish is to have all funds received before the end of 2019. We know this is asking a lot, however, in order to take advantage of potential affordable leased sites for our start-up location, we need to act soon. This will also allow us to start the first crop production in early 2020 and also maximize the total annual crop production in 2020. This is very important as all information pertaining to each grow cycle is data mined in order to develop an efficient and effective Operations Manal and Growing Guidelines & Recommendations to be used as the blueprints for every future Eden Lodge constructed.One of the goals of Eden Lodge is to create viable employment within the communities it serves. One of our long term objectives is to eventually transition the first Eden Lodge into a Training and Support Center. This will support and strengthen the ""hands-on"" training each community will acquire to operate their own Eden Lodge. This will help ensure each community has the competently trained workers needed to operate their own Eden Lodge. By creating green employment opportunities, and producing healthy, affordable organic foods for communities and regions that are currently lacking economic development, we are making the world a better place.Changing the world one person at a time is something and a good start, however, we believe we can change the world one community at a time and have a greater positive impact on the health of our planet. Once we have proven the worth of Eden Lodge our intent is to give it to the communities that need it the most. Communities like urban low-income neighborhoods and northern located First Nations communities.  We have already agreed to a partnership with a Manitoba First Nation community, and have set an aggressive goal of having the first ""community site"" built within an 18-month time frame of our start-up location.   WE CAN ACT NOW. WE CAN MAKE POSITIVE CHANGE HAPPEN. We are extremely busy in trying to bring Eden Lodge to fruition and very much need your assistance to make this project a reality. Any help is greatly appreciated! We can not begin to express our gratitude to those that truly want to make the world a better place by generously donating to this project. Together we can be agents of CHANGE. Together we CAN make a difference. Together we can make the world a BETTER place.  No matter what you believe, there is still time to help make positive change.","October 21, 2019",0,"$450,000 goal"
Martin Parker ,"Dundas, ON",Community & Neighbors,"Fight Climate Change! Get Ontario GeoREDE!Summary  The lack of Government policy for development of Deep Geothermal Renewable Energy in Ontario is holding back the growth of this baseload renewable energy source. This deep thermal energy resource can potentially be used for both electrical and thermal energy production. Part of the geothermal fluid can be tapped off as a direct heat source for urban or industrial geothermal heating systems (i.e. district heating). This could prompt the local development of other industries with need of the heat, such as food drying, aquaculture and greenhouse farming. Many jobs will be created to build the Projects and associated businesses. The rest of the world, especially Europe, is moving quickly to use this deep renewable resource for heat & power. Projects of up to 7000m depth are either being built or under study. In Finland one Project has already drilled 6,400m deep wells. In the UK the United Downs Project has drilled to depths of over 5,200m. The Eden Project, also in the UK, has recently announced funding and that they will be starting their deep EGS Project next year.  Every week new Projects are being started around the world. The energy potential beneath Ontario is huge and the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions equally large. Help us work to get Ontario moving in the right direction of energy use. For ourselves, our children, grandchildren and their children let’s get Ontario GeoREDE.(Geothermal Renewable Energy from Deep Earth)Any amount helps........but numbers count!Money raised is critical for the required environmental, statistical, economic and technical studies to use to present and convince the Ontario Government to create the correct policy, but if we can get a large number of people to contribute any amount, even small amounts, this will also help when we speak with Government players to show that the public wants these developments and the clean, renewable energy they can supply. Help us fight Climate Change - Please Donate.Visit our Facebook page or web site for more details.Overview Geothermal Renewable Energy from Deep Earth is a proven, growing and economical form of Renewable Energy Generation that supplies base load energy & capacity 24/7 rain or shine. When constructed in the right location and using the correct design, a deep EGS Geothermal plant has little or no effect on the environment, produces no pollution from operation and can actually reduce greenhouse gas production by replacing natural gas or other fossil fuel generation.  If we develop large-scale (>60MWe) deep EGS geothermal plants the levelized unit energy cost (LUEC) of the resultant energy could be as low as $78 (2019) per MWh (average electrical & thermal). Plant life of over 30 years. Plant capacity factors of greater than 90% are typical.  Lower cost than natural gas and nuclear. Deep EGS Geothermal @ $0.078 per kWh. Lower cost & higher capacity factor than all other base load power supply.  Any available emissions credit $$ value would lower this Levelized Unit Energy Cost. Geothermal energy is derived from heat produced in the subsurface. Heat is generated from natural radiogenic decay of elements in the upper crust as well as heat generated from the formation of the planet. While there is a natural flow of heat from depth to the surface anywhere on Earth, local geological processes & fractures can lead to high-temperature geothermal resources that are within economic drilling depths.  
Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) is a newer type of geothermal power technology. EGS does not require naturally occurring permeable rock or in situ thermal water reservoirs. Instead this evolving technology is used to drill heat exchanger holes (closed loop system) or ""enhance"" high temperature rocks at great depth (in Ontario likely greater than 5500m in deep granite- this is far below the sedimentary rock and any water tables). This is a closed cycle system of water use – after initial filling no water is consumed – filtered wastewater/runoff can be used. All water used is recycled back into the ground for reuse. Successful development of EGS technology promises to greatly broaden the regions with geothermal electrical generation potential. Just as ongoing technology improvements in the exploration and development of natural gas and oil resources, such as horizontal drilling, have led to dramatic increases in the fossil fuel resource base and corresponding decreases in commodity prices, new technology and learning-by-doing can reduce the cost of generating electricity from geothermal energy. This is particularly true for EGS, which is technology-based rather than exploration-based. (from: HERO report to Parker – Hotrock Energy Resource Organization – May 2017) Development of Deep Geothermal Energy has been compared to mining – but in this case we are mining for deep renewable heat. We believe that in the granite bedrock under the sedimentary basin in Southwestern Ontario we have these deep heat resources available for potential deep Geothermal energy. Some areas (due to possible deep faulting) will have the resource at shallower depths.  Benefits The development of Deep Ontario EGS Geothermal Renewable Energy has many benefits including;·      Systems will be designed to create best efficiency & method of generation·      Does not rely on Geologic conditions for location. Can be located very close to load centers as needed. Can use brownfield land, quarries, etc.·      Very small development footprint on the surface.·      Uses proven equipment for power generation. ·      Can generate very efficiently at partial load points.  ·      Operation as base load due to high availability·      Modular and scalable (Capacity from 2 MW or less to 100’s of MW)·      Closed cycle system of water use – after initial filling no water consumed– filtered wastewater/runoff can be used.·      Significant thermal energy available for district heating system or commercial/industrial user. ·      No combustion involved - no emissions from operation Employment Development of geothermal power plants and direct-use applications of the thermal energy creates a variety of jobs. As an example, the development of a Geothermal Spa Resort to utilize the thermal energy and water can create many jobs to run & manage the resort. Greenhouse & aquaculture Projects would supply other substantial local employment. Generally, the necessary temperature for a geothermal heated agriculture or aquaponics project is around 70°C. An area sized @ 21 acres of greenhouses generate net revenue of $5.2 million USD annually, cost approximately $15-$20 million USD, which equals a payback of approximately 3 to 4 years. Moreover, a project of this size generates approximately 8 jobs per acre, which equals 168 fulltime jobs for 21 acres. (Source: Economics of Heat vs. Power Only, Jerry Smith, NREL 2015) Direct employment would include jobs during construction along with jobs during the long-term operation of the Projects. Other jobs would include those in plant design, and power plant equipment manufacturing. All the job creation and economic activity within the geothermal industry would positively impact many other areas of the Ontario economy.

Use of the residual thermal energy for heating/cooling (chillers) will also reduce emissions from other sources by an additional over 570,000 tonnes a year. So that is at least 913,000 tonnes a year of reduced emissions for each project. The technical potential in Southwest Ontario is huge (by some estimates greater than 175 million MWthermal so ~1.75 million MWe) but even if only 4 plants (4 x 60MWe) were built by 2030 that would be over 3.6 megatonnes per year of reduced greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalent). Life expectancy of 30 years minimum and possibly up to 50 years or more depending on design. The Problem While there are some regulations in place for shallow geothermal heat-pump type development, Ontario’s laws do not yet regulate deep geothermal development – imposing significant uncertainty for geothermal developers. Until these regulations and policies are in place, developers and investors are not prepared to take the risk on deep geothermal in Ontario. A legal definition of geothermal resources in Ontario does not yet exist, and it is not clear who owns the resources or how the rights to their development can be obtained. It is also unclear how the physical activities (i.e. deep drilling) associated with geothermal development will be regulated.  The lack of policy on these issues is deterring Ontario from developing this source of clean energy. To harness Ontario’s deep geothermal resources, the province must develop a legal framework that enables responsible development, provides investment clarity and is technology agnostic, i.e., does not get in the way of the wide array and ever-changing suite of emerging geothermal technologies. (from: Hot Commodity: Geothermal electricity in Alberta - Canada West Foundation – 2018) Other Canadian Provinces are experiencing similar issues.  British Columbia is currently the only Province with a defined Geothermal Policy.  While the Canadian Geothermal industry group CanGEA through their ongoing powEARTHful campaign has been working to lobby the Federal Government for more geothermal funding no one in Ontario is actively addressing this issue– we believe, as do many others around the world, that the time of burning fossil fuels for heat and electrical energy has run out !We need to get deep geothermal development moving in Ontario so we can replace these dirty, non-renewable sources with clean, base-load renewable energy. Our goal is to get Ontario Government policy and procedures in place to allow for the active development of the deep geothermal resources and provide a clearly defined path so Ontario can utilize this relatively low-cost base-load renewable energy.  Secondary goal is to de-risk the development of large scale Deep Geothermal Projects by working towards the development of a small-scale Pilot Project along with work to provide baseline environmental study requirements, relevant costing studies and proof of resource to supply to potential Deep Geothermal developers.  Part of this work will involve discussions with interested drilling companies on ways to lower the cost of deep drilling, which is a substantial part (generally 50%-60%) of any Geothermal Project. Another aspect will be to discuss with turbine/generator suppliers what they can provide & possibly build in Ontario.  First Nations We have been in contact and had discussions & meetings with a major Ontario First Nation since November 2017. Their treaty area covers a lot of the Southern Ontario area we are considering as prime location for small scale & large scale Deep Geothermal Projects. We firmly believe that the First Nations are entitled to benefit from the deep thermal energy resource that exists beneath our feet.  Our goal is to continue the ongoing dialogue we have with them and hopefully get their active involvement in the creation of a Deep Geothermal Energy policy in Ontario that provides both methods of employment for their people and potential revenue sources for the First Nations.   Use of Funds We have been working over 2 years gathering relevant research/information and contacting companies that will generate the required detailed technical, environmental, economic and statistical studies to assist with lobbying of the Ontario Provincial and the Canadian Federal Governments. We have the plans prepared and the environmental experts, engineering experts and government relations consultants already prepared and ready to commence once funding is in place.  Even though energy is a provincial responsibility, the Federal Government is doing far more regarding Geothermal than the Province of Ontario. Federal tax incentives are in place that allow flow through shares for development costs along with accelerated write down of capital costs. Federal grant money is also being given to help geothermal development in other Provinces.  The first $100,000 of funds raised would be used to pay for scientific and technical studies that will be used by Ontario Geothermal Renewable Energy Inc. and consultants to educate, advocate and encourage Ontario down the correct path to deep geothermal developments. These documents will be presented to Ontario Government Ministries and politicians during lobbying efforts by us and our government relations consultants.  Discussions with staff & politicians from potential City users of the energy such as Toronto, Hamilton, London, Windsor etc. will be pursued. We believe these lobbying efforts will cost another $75,000 to $100,000 dollars. Funds will be spent to work with the Ontario market regulator (IESO), Ontario utilities, industry and other entities to determine the best means to establish power purchase agreements for the electrical energy along with power sales agreements for the thermal energy produced. It is estimated that $75,000 will be needed for this task.  An additional $50,000 of the funds would be used to fund a public awareness and educational campaign to help Get Ontario GeoREDE.Funds will also go to GoFundMe to cover costs. Costs are 2.9% and $0.30 per transaction. This will vary depending on amount raised. It is estimated at ~$25,000.Any extra funds would be used to continue with the ongoing development of an initial small Pilot Project of approximately 5 MW electrical. From this Project we also expect to get about 10 MW thermal energy. This Project will be used to prove the deep heat resource, the feasibility of Deep Geothermal in Ontario and de-risk future projects by creating a procedural and environmental development path.  This will help attract the developer attention required for the large-scale Projects we wish to have built in Ontario. Once we have a design ready, the same basic layouts and well sizes etc. can be used in areas with similar geology. In Ontario this would mean we could locate anywhere we have the electrical & thermal load requirements just by drilling deeper or adding more wells. Examples of locations where the electrical energy & thermal power could be used include: •       Large scale residential development (district heating & localized energy)•       Large shopping Malls (heat & energy)•       Airports & Stadiums•       Mines (new or active)•       Greenhouse (marijuana) or other agricultural/growing or aquaculture operations•       Remote First Nation or other communitiesProjects could be built along with or alongside new developments or built at existing locations. As an example, drilling and equipment to supply heat & power to a large shopping mall or stadium could occur in the parking lot areas and feed into existing thermal heating to eliminate fossil fuel fired boilers. Similar setup could occur at airports, with the drilling and equipment out in the large runway and taxi areas. Once built most of the well facilities would not be visible. Video of EGS Geothermal - note that our Projects will likely be closed loop to ensure good water flows.https://youtu.be/lf069ukVXU8

A crop system where there’s room for everyone, from the smallest mite to the coyote and hawk. Entire ecosystems exist here in a place that was once a corn and soybean desert. Because of us. Because of Badgersett.And with your help this system can be brought to other farms.We have developed these crops; new, advanced hybrid varieties of Hazelnut, Chestnut and Pecan that can grow and thrive in northern climates, over decades. They produce FOOD; oil, protein, complex carbohydrates . Enough food that they are competitive with annual agriculture. We’ve demonstrated it.Badgersett has been working for 40 years. Its founder, Philip Rutter, created the American Chestnut Foundation from a plan to breed trees like farmers profitably breed cattle, and an iron will to what is now a powerful 3 million dollar annual conservation organization. Everyone told him that it was a fool’s errand. Tilting at windmills. A dead horse. But Philip found the dreamers still willing to believe, and brought them together. Together they saved the tree, one all experts agreed couldn’t be saved.This is the determination that went into building Badgersett. It is a success story that we hope you will become a part of.We already have 100’s of growers across the US and Canada, who believe in us, and rely on us year after year. We have been there for them, but we need your help to continue to support them.We have partnered with universities across the US to fund crop development research. Our test planting at Oberlin College grew at an astounding rate and, as we have been promising, it produced nuts in 3.5 years. Those plants have borne heavier crops every year since. Our crops are not GMO.  They are simply hybrids of plants that have been separated since the continents drifted. By hybridizing them, we opened their potential in the same way our ancestors bred beans, squash and potatoes. That potential can in fact- feed the world.  It really could save the planet. Be a part of it.Our farm fossil fuel use has been cut by 90%. Let me repeat that… 90%. In 2011 we used 600 gallons of fuel to mow and plow. Then we got our horses, and soon there after we got the sheep. They now do work once done by machines. They graze, dropping manure that feed the trees and grass as they go. Which makes the grass greener, the trees bigger and more productive, and the animals fatter. The system nearly feeds itself now. In 2016 we bought 55 gallons of diesel. 600 gallons reduced to 55. That’s amazing in anyone’s book. Now Badgersett needs your help to continue. Climate change is happening faster than anyone imagined. In the last 3 years we have faced warmer fall and winter temperatures, making crop storage difficult. We have faced crop killing droughts followed by floods. And windstorms so severe that it was as if a hurricane hit Minnesota. Our trees have survived this. We have survived this, but the damage and burden has slowed down our ability to continue our work.Our machines and buildings need repair. Our mortgage needs to be paid. And most of our funding sources have dried up, because face it, quietly working for decades doesn’t bring in the headlines. So we are looking to you; people who still believe in a better world to help move Badgersett forward so our successes can continue for the next 40 years and beyond.Please donate today. You will save the planet. Really.Here, again is the link to our award winning video from the 2013 MIT Climate CoLab Contest. Please watch. http://tinyurl.com/l598yog*Who will benefit?The entire cosmos...

Bianca Pomerleau ,"Sainte-Foy, QC","Medical, Illness & Healing","RÉSUMÉ DE LA CAMPAGNEAugustin est atteint du SCN8A, une maladie très rare : il est le premier cas au Québec et environ le 150e au monde. Le SCN8A provoque une épilepsie réfractaire à la médication, dont découlent plusieurs autres troubles et symptômes. Son physiatre et sa pédiatre ont, d'un commun accord, prescrit un traitement par oxygénothérapie hyperbare, une approche remplie d'espoir pour Augustin, mais qui s'ajoute au fardeau financier que représente la maladie pour les parents d'Augustin. Notre objectif est de les aider financièrement, afin qu'ils puissent, dans un premier temps, louer une chambre hyperbare, puis, éventuellement en acheter une. Le coût total (dans le cas de l'achat) s'élève à 28 000 $. Les parents d'Augustin envisagent la possibilité de faire profiter de la chambre à d'autres dans le besoin une fois les traitements initiaux terminés.THE CAMPAIGN IN A NUTSHELLAugustin suffers from a very rare disorder: SNC8A Epilepsy. He is the first diagnosed case in the province of Quebec (Canada), and approximately the 150th in the world. SNC8A is a type of epilepsy that is resistant to medication and comes with many difficult symptoms. Augustin’s physiatrist and paediatrician have both recommended hyperbaric oxygen therapy, an approach that fills us with hope for Augustin, but which represents a heavy financial burden for his parents. Our objective is to help them cover the cost of renting a hyperbaric chamber for a trial period, and to eventually buy it if little Augustin responds well to the therapy. The initial 40 day rental will cost 2 900$ (CAD), and buying the chamber will cost a further 25 000$ (CAD).Augustin' parents are considering the possibility of sharing the room with others in need once the initial treatments are completed.***English will follow***AUGUSTIN, SCN8A et OXYGÉNOTHÉRAPIE HYPERBAREAugustinAugustin, c'est un un fils tant attendu, un petit-fils adoré, un petit-frère doublement choyé, un neveu, un filleul, un cousin... C'est un garçon joyeux, qui aime rire aux éclats, raffole des chatouilles,  adore la musique... Il a maintenant 1 an et demi et il est atteint du SCN8A.Le SCN8AUn paquet de lettres, un chiffre, et une montagne d'inconnu.Augustin est le premier au Québec et environ le 150edans le monde à être atteint du SCN8A, une mutation génétique très rare qui provoque, entre autres, une épilepsie réfractaire à la médication, dont plusieurs autres symptômes découlent.Augustin est atteint :·       de cécité corticale·       d’hypotonie sévère·       de convulsions réfractaires à la médication·       de troubles de sommeil·       de mouvements involontaires·       de spasmes infantiles·       de difficultés d’alimentation·       de retard dans le développement langagier·       etc.De plus, sa condition le met particulièrement à risque : ·       d’apnée centrale·       de troubles au niveau de larynx·       d’arythmie et de bradycardie cardiaques·       de problèmes d’orthopédie (scoliose, etc.)·       de mort subite·       etc. La petite histoire de vie d'Augustin24 heures de vie. C'est l'âge qu'avait Augustin lors de son premier épisode de convulsions. Rapidement, il est tombé dans un état de « status épileptique »; c’est-à-dire que malgré la médication donnée, les convulsions n'arrêtaient pas. Intubé d’urgence afin d'éviter un possible arrêt respiratoire causé par la médication, il a ensuite été transféré en avion-ambulance au Children’s hospital à Montréal pour recevoir des soins spécialisés.Selon les premiers EEG passés, il convulsait environ 20 heures sur 24. À une semaine de vie, Augustin avait perdu tous ses réflexes, sauf celui de la succion, et n’avait plus aucun tonus. Coup dur pour ses parents, ses soeurs, sa famille; on ne savait pas ce qu'il allait devenir.Ses parents sontrestés à son chevet durant un mois aux soins intensifs néonatals avant qu’il reçoive son congé.4 mars 2017...« On a trouvé une anomalie dans les gênes de votre fils. »L’équipe de généticiens et de neurologues avaient trouvé, non sans difficulté, l'origine de ce mal étrange qui affectait Augustin.Le SCN8A. Parfois aussi appelé le « cutesyndrom ».Durant sa première année de vie, Augustin a été admis d'urgence à l'hôpital 53 fois, dont 50 se sont soldées par une hospitalisation.Il est, depuis, suivi par un neurologue, un cardiologue, un pneumologue, un pédiatre, un physiatre, un physiothérapeute, une ergothérapeute, un ostéopathe, une travailleuse sociale et toute une équipe de généticiens. Il a plusieurs examens à son actif, dont 12 EEG, 2 écho cardiaques, 3 IRM, 1 scan, 3 échographies, 2 examens en audiologie, 2 examens  en ophtalmologique, 4 Rayon X, 2 ponctions lombaires...Ses parents passent aussi environ 1 à 2 heures par jour à faire les exercices de stimulation en raison de son hypotonie sévère.Depuis décembre, Augustin doit suivre une diète cétogène très stricte, entreprise avec l’aide de la neurologue. La bonne nouvelle, c'est que les progrès sont là, encourageants. Rien n'est gagné, mais nous pouvons observer une belle amélioration dans son tonus et son développement. Oxygénothérapie hyperbareRécemment, d'un accord commun, le physiatre et la pédiatre d'Augustin ont suggéré un traitement d'oxygénothérapie hyperbare. « Simplement respirer de l'oxygère pure dans un atmosphère légèrement pressurisée peut faire de nombreux, petits et grands miracles. »Tout comme dans le cas de la diète cétogène, entreprise en décembre, il est impossible de connaître l'effet qu'aura le traitement sur la condition d'Augustin. La seule façon, c'est de l'essayer. La diète ayant donné d'excellents résultats, il va se soi que ses parents n'ont qu'une envie : foncer.Un premier traitement consiste en des séances quotidiennes de 1 heure 30 durant 40 jours. Cela représente « une dose ». Par la suite, si des améliorations notables sont perceptibles, ils poursuivront à raison de 2 à 3 fois par semaine. Un fardeau financierLa maladie d'Augustin représente un fardeau financier important pour ses parents. Additionnée aux frais liés aux nombreuses hospitalisations, aux absences au travail, à la nécessaire réorganisation de leurs vies professionnelles,aux rendez-vous à gauche et à droite, auxaller-retoursfréquents entre Amos et Montréal, au lait spécialisé –remboursé en partie par des assurances privées, dieu merci – à 900 $/mois, aux médicaments qui ne sont pas tous couverts, à certains services professionnels et à l'équipement spécialisé, la dépense liée à la location, voire à l'achat, d'une chambre hyperbare, donne le vertige. Notre objectifNous, familles et amis de Clément et de Marylin, avons pour objectifd'ammasser, dans un premier temps, 2 900 $ (CAD) afin que les parents d'Augustin, Marylin et Clément, puisse couvrir les frais de location d'une chambre hyperbare. Si le traitement devait démontrer des effets positifs, ils devront envisager procéder à l'achat. Dans un tel cas, les frais avoisinent les 28 000$ (CAD). Les coûts de la location étant soustraits, l'achat reviendrait aux alentours de 25 000 $ CA. Mais chaque chose en son temps : commençons par le commencement. La chambre sera louée, et éventuellement achetée chez Hypersanté : http://www.hypersante.com/ Votre soutien est précieuxVotre aide fait la différence. Que votre don se compte en unités, en dizaines ou en centaines, rien ne sera perdu. Si nous devions dépasser notre objectif ou que les coûts de location ou de d'achat devaient être revus un peu à la baisse, les surplus serviront à aider les parents d'Augustin à payer le lait spécialisé, des équipements nécessaires, des séances avec des professionnels au besoin, etc. Bref, tout l'argent ira directement aux bons soins d'Augustin, vous avez notre parole!***ENGLISH VERSION***AUGUSTIN, SCN8A EPILEPSY and HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPYAugustinAugustin is a son, grandson, little brother, nephew, godson, and cousin who is loved and adored. A happy boy who loves laughing, tickles, and music… He’s now one and a half years old and he has a condition called SCN8A Epilepsy.SCN8A EpilepsyA bunch of letters, a number and a whole lot of unknown.Augustin is the first diagnosed case of SNC8A Epilepsy in the province of Quebec (Canada) and approximately the 150th case in the world. SNC8A is a rare genetic mutation which causes, amongst other things, a type of epilepsy that is resistant to medicationandcomes with several other symptoms.Augustin suffers from:·        Cortical blindness·        Severe hypotonia·        Seizures refractory to medication·        Sleepdisorders·        Involuntary movements·        Infantile spasms·        Difficulty eating·        Delay in speech development·        etcFurthermore, he is at a high risk of:·        Central apnoea·        Larynx issues·        Cardiac arrhythmia and bradycardia·        Orthopaedic issues (scoliosis, etc)·        Sudden death·        etcLittle Augustin’s life story24 hours of life. That was Augustin’s age when he had his first seizures. He quickly fell in a state of “status epilepticus”; even after being administrated medication, his seizures just weren’t stopping.In order to avoid respiratory arrest due to the medication, he was given an emergency intubation and transferred by ambulance-plane to Montreal’s Children Hospital, where he would receive specialised care.His first EEG revealed that he was having seizures 20 hours a day. A week later, Augustin had lost all his newborn reflexes, except the sucking reflex, and had no muscle tonus anymore. A hard blow for his parents, sisters, family; we just didn’t know what would happen to him.His parents stayed with him at the hospital’s neonatal intensive care for a month, after which he got the green light to go home.“We found an anomaly in your son’s genes”After several months of hard work, a team of geneticists and neurologistsidentifiedthe strange affliction Augustin was suffering from. SNC8A Epilepsy, also known as “The Cute Syndrome”.In his first year of life, Augustin ended up in the hospital’s emergency room 53 times. Out of these 53 trips, he ended up being admitted and hospitalized 50 times.He is followed by a neurologist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a paediatrician, a physiatrist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, an osteopath, a social worker and a whole team of geneticists. He has already been through many tests, including 12 EEGs, 2 cardiac ultrasounds, 3 MRIs, 1 scan, 3 general ultrasounds, 2 audiology tests, 2 ophthalmic tests, 4 X-rays, 2 lumbar punctures…His parents spend 1 to 2 hours a day doing stimulation exercises with him, due to his severe hypotonia.Starting December last year, Augustin is on a strict ketogenic diet, which was recommended by his neurologist. The good news is that this diet allowed Augustin to make some progress. The battle continues, but we can see an encouraging improvement of his muscle tonus and general development.Hyperbaric oxygen therapyRecently, Augustin’s physiatrist and paediatrician have both recommendedhyperbaric oxygen therapy.“If we can get Augustin to breathe pure oxygen in a slightly pressurised atmosphere, many small and big miracles could happen”As was the case with the ketogenic diet, which Augustin started in December, it is impossible to predict the exact effect that the treatment will have. The only way to find out is to try it. Given that the diet yielded excellent results, it is only natural that Augustin’s parents want to go for it.The first part of the treatment consists of daily 1.5 hour sessions in the chamber, for 40 days. That consists of a “dose”. After that dose, if a notable improvement can be observed, the treatment would continue 2 to 3 times a week.The financial burdenAugustin’sparents bear a heavy financial burden due to his condition. On top of the costs so far – the numerous hospitalisations, absences from work, adjusting their professional lives, appointments left, right and centre, frequent trips from Amos (their home town) to Montreal (a 6 hour drive one-way), special 900$/month milk (partly covered by their insurance, thank goodness), medications not covered by health care, professional services and specialised equipment – the cost of renting, and perhaps buying a hyperbaric chamber is enough to make anyone dizzy.Our objectiveWe, the friends and family of Clément and Marilyn (Augustin’s parents), wish to raise 2 900$ (CAD) to cover a 40 day rental of a hyperbaric chamber for Augustin. This would be the first step.If the treatment yields positive results, they will need to consider buying the chamber. The cost of a hyperbaric chamber is around 28 000$ (CAD). The initial rental payment would be subtracted from that total, which means that the purchase would come to an additional 25 000$ (CAD).But first things first – the rental.The hyperbaric chamber will be rented, and eventually bought from Hypersanté: http://www.hypersante.com/ Your support is invaluableYour help makes such a difference.Regardless of whether your donation is in single, double or triple digits – every dollar counts.If we exceed our objective and/or the cost of the hyperbaric chamber ends up being a bit lower than expected, the extra funds will be used to cover the cost of Augustin’sketogenic milk, specialised equipment, services with professionals, etc. In other words, every single penny will go towards Augustin’s care, that’s a promise!","June 11, 2018","$29,030","$28,000 "

I work part time and starting this week, I'm only set for 20 hours and my last day of work is April 18th.I need to make sure that I can legally take my son to Canada without any complications. I contacted an immigration lawyer and he told me that since I'm Canadian, my son can live in Canada as a Canadian as well. We will be starting his Canadian citizenship certificate and passport as soon as we arrive in Canada.As of April 1st, I lost my healthcare coverage through work. I am currently trying to pay off a medical bill for when I was tested for diabetes ($175 is left). I recently saw my doctor about depression and anxiety so I am waiting for that bill to come too.

The papers are done but just haven't been filed yet. It costs $680 to file it. If I let my green card expire, the immigration lawyer says it will really complicate my travel into and out of the USA in the next couple of years.This GoFundMe will really help me out a lot as I have been severely depressed and stressed.

Jocelyn Burzuik ,"Winnipeg Beach, MB",Business & Entrepreneurs,"My name is Jocelyn Burzuik, the President of Sundance Construction and we are in a fight against the Manitoba Government for the good of our company, the livelihood of our great staff, and the many suppliers we work with.When we started out in 2013, we did everything right and we were a fast growing, Metis female lead construction company.  Our team is family based, and we worked hard to get a solid foothold in the industry as a builder across many fronts.  The problem started in Nelson House, MB. We were awarded a project to build a raw water intake - and we did.  This project was directly with the Province of Manitoba through the Department of Indigenous Municipal Relations (IMR) - no one in between.  But we were never paid for our contract.  The problems started almost immediately.  We had a lack of engineering support, incorrect design elevations, overland flooding.  Normally, all of this is addressed through your contract. You file notices for change orders, negotiate, and move ahead.  But not in this case.  In this case, the department just put their head in the sand and refused to move forward or accept their responsibility for the problems.  They forced me to continue to work, get the job done, even though I protested as per my contract and in writing.  And then, they left me holding the bag on all of it.  They have cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars in direct costs - and they have not even come to the table to talk in over three years.In addition to the above - they have left the community of Nelson House without a long term water solution.Since April of 2016 – we have not been paid anything on this project.Our project was insured and bonded.  We engaged the insurance company from the beginning of the project, and they tried for two years to get the Province to follow their contract, and make a decision.  The Province has ignored them and we have that backed up in writing.  We filed numerous notices of claim under our contract, and no response.  Not even an acknowledgement.  In every single one of their letters to me – they specify a timeline to respond.  But when I reply, or send in a claim, we are ignored.  From May of 2016, until now both the insurance company and I have done everything possible to help the Province find a solution to the issues on site.  We brought in outside engineering, surveying and outside independent expertise.  These issues are truly a no-brainer and ones that I have faced on other projects with other companies.  On January 4th, 2019 – Intact Insurance threw in the towel and walked away because the Province will not engage in the process laid out by the contract we both signed.We have gone to the media, we have gone to the Manitoba Ombudsman, we have gone to opposition leaders for both parties, tried physically connecting with the Minister for IMR.  Nothing. As a citizen, and business owner - what do you do when the Government does not pay their bills, does not follow the rules, does not follow their own contract, breaks environmental legislation, professional legislation in regard to engineering and more?  What do you do when your insurance company – Intact Insurance cannot even get a response from the Government?  Members of the department indicated that they had the resources to wait me out - and bankrupt our company.  Since when is level of Government allowed to take action to put a company out of business?  Apparently - any time they want unless you can fight.  And I am one hell of a fighter.In Canada - we have laws which state that government has ""a duty of care to the taxpayer"".  It means that when government prevents a business from operating as per usual, when it causes a business to lay off people, prevent a business from paying suppliers and sub-trades - they are liable for all of it.  They become liable for the impact to my business, my family and my livelihood.  Right now - they are telling me that they don't care.   I need to make them care because I have employees, and their families as well as my own to look after.I did what so many others in this country work hard to do - I built a business on my name, and on my ability to do the work.  I am a design-builder and I have proven time and time again that we can do great things across the Province.  I have lead and successfully completed millions of dollars’ worth of construction projects throughout my career.  I did not work off of government grants, even though I am both Metis and female - I built this business from the ground up with my own hands and work and that of the fantastic people that have worked with me.  No government agent, or department should ever have the ability to destroy a successful and competent business through non-payment and inaction.  As taxpayers, we need to see every small business succeed and grow.  Because this is not just about my company - it is about my community, my employees, their families, and local businesses that are directly impacted by what happens to our business.Most departments I have worked for with the Province have good people, and they run well.  I have worked for the Manitoba Water Services Board, Manitoba Housing, Manitoba Hydro - and they all are professional and well run.  I don't understand what has happened with this Department (IMR) and why there is no desire to even see a resolution. On the federal side – I experienced almost the exact situation with INAC and a General Contractor from the Interlake.  We were subcontracted on a bonded and insured project, and in the end (October 2016), the GC simply decided not to pay us.  Well – now we were out the door with another $208,000.  In this case, we sued and wait for our day in court.  But again, it was unnecessary.  A contract was in place, language in place to ensure an Owner (INAC) pays subs out trust monies, progress payments, and the big one – GST.  None of that happened. In our case, the engineer on the project, and the consultant for INAC decided to ignore the language of the contract.  What does this mean for the Canadian taxpayer?  It means that they slid all of the liability from the General Contractor and passed it up to the Government of Canada.  Again – the requirement of “a duty of care to the taxpayer” was simply ignored.One level of government (the federal government) green lights non-payment to our company, and the Provincial Government of Manitoba physically drains my company of over $500,000 in direct costs, non-payment on a contract, and indirect losses of over 1.7 million to date.  The irony of all of this – CRA has bullied and intimidated our company during this time to see funds for which government has never paid us.  During my last conversation with an agent on the business side – he told me that he doesn’t care what has happened and that these “monies” belong to the Government. I could understand those statements if it were someone other than the government that owed us money.  But in our case, the government pulls from one side in not paying – and from the other side in demanding taxes, GST etc. I am not sure if I could ever adequately describe the level of rage and disgust I felt at that moment.  Government wants a fight – well game on!  The Metis Nation has been fighting government since before this Province was formed.  It’s in my history, in my blood – and I will fight until I have nothing left to fight with.I am starting a go fund me account to set up a legal defense fund to take the fight to them, and to get my story out there.  Our company is well run - and we have always made the money we needed to run a successful business.  But when a client like the Province of Manitoba does not pay the bill - and runs up our costs - we have to find another way.   Right now - both indirectly and directly, the Province has sucked out 2.3 million dollars from our company over three years.  They have taken our savings, our retirement, and every penny we put into this business.  Our suppliers and subs needed to be paid so we did everything in our power to get them looked after. How do we explain the impact this has had?  Imagine your employer had withheld your pay cheque – AFTER you had done the work to earn it, and had the money set aside to cover the monthly bills like a mortgage, utilities, or car payments. The money that the government withheld was all of that and more to us only on a much bigger scale.Each day, we find a way to keep making things right for the people, and businesses that we are responsible to.  It’s just the way life is supposed to work when you are a part of a community.  So, in spite of it all – I find a way and we fight.Update - we have been asked why we fight so hard - and it is because of these little ones - our sons that we fight.  For their future, for our employees' families, for all of us.  But, it is our sons that drive us to never give up.","February 15, 2019",$860,"$25,000 "

I've arrived here in financial desperation... and I truly hope that when you hear the story of Char''s Landing, the heart of our community, Port Alberni, Vancouver Island, you will want to help.I am Charlene Patterson.  Born and raised in the Okanagan, near Kelowna, BC, Canada.  The 5th of 6 kids and family singing in 4 part harmony in the car on the way to church continues to be a happy memory.I graduated in 1979, then Vancouver computer consulting for 20 years, then lived on Cruise Ships running the computer department for 12 years.   Stressful job but met a ton of wonderful people, was introduced to a multitude of beautiful cultures and saw incredible sights.  I have been blessed.Retired and looked for a place where I could buy land near the ocean with a building where I could live and have a business opportunity.  Through an incredible sequence of lucky cooincidences, I found this beautiful building right in the heart of Port Alberni's Arts District that originated as a First Methodist Church with first service August 4th, 1912.  Moved to town April 1st 2010 and re-named the building Char's Landing.  After 30 years working in aviation and the marines, I have planted my feet firmly on the ground. The Port Alberni community of 18,000+ welcomed me with open arms and inspired me to host concerts and community events.  Fully renovated the building into my apartment, a 3 room guesthouse plus a meeting space with 150 person capacity.  Employed/Purchased all local and brought new life to the building, all new plumbing, electrical, heat, sewer, perimeter, painted the exterior, built a beautiful deck and ramp, created green spaces for a wide variety of flowers.I have been so lucky for the support and have really dug into my new community.  During the first years I was asked to sit on the board of the Arts Council, the board of Rotary and the board of the Chamber.   I have been 100% engaged in the future of this beautiful community, and shared in the transition from it's mill town roots.It has been such an honour to host travellers and to present singer/songwriters from all over the world.  They contact me to play for our now well known stellar acoustics and attentive listening audiences.  I take such pride in what we have created and the joy that it gives.  Char's Landing has given me a life full of joy and friendship.  For this I am eternally greatful.However, April 1st, 2016 as I started my 7th year here and sadly had the awakening that I could not make payroll.  Seems I have been living off my savings and investments and finally credit cards all this time.  Month after month loosing money.  Crazy I let it go this far.  I was forced to lay off staff and cut any extra expenses.  I decided to share my story and now I have asked the community for a miracle to keep our doors open.One big step is my application to the City of Port Alberni to rezone the property from commercial to residential, as the primary use of the building is for my home.  Residential status would allow me to apply for a personal line of credit, at a low interest rate, which would allow me to pay off my credit cards and 10% commercial mortgage.  I'm currently paying $2500 per month in interest alone !!!The City Planner helped me through the application and the fee is $1200, which I do not currently have.  So, I thought I'd ask the gofundme world if they would help.   Will you help me, with my eternal thanks?I built Char's Landing to give me a life, full of community, friends, art, music.  I am so very grateful to have that now but am afraid if I cannot get out of this incredible financial debt, I will have to close, and disapoint the thousands that consider my 2000sqft living room, their home away from home.Thank you for allowing me to share my story...

Callie Pittman ,"Leverett, MA",Education & Learning,"Last semester, I began to look into other options for high school that would subtract over stimulation from my daily life due to a long term concussion. Kroka Expeditions is a wilderness expedition school based out of Marlow NH. Kroka offers a winter semester program and a fall semester program as well as summer expeditions for students ranging from 9 to 18. Growing up I attended four of Kroka's summer programs that took me to various lakes, rivers, and mountains in New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, and Northern Canada. The second semester of my junior year, I took part in Kroka's 2019 Actic to Manhattan Semester.  In the span of a 5 month period, Kroka guided me alongside 11 other students skiing in the Green Mountains and Northern Canada in the winter months, and then canoeing down Lake Champlain, the Hudson, the Harlem, and East River to New York City in the spring. This semester provided me with experiences and lessons that I would not be able to achieve within the confines of public schooling. This Kroka semester allowed me to explore the ways that I learn best as a student and the ways best to hold myself within the world that we live in through hands on and physically pushing activities. Next fall, I will be returning to Kroka for their Roaring Canyons Semester. Not only will I be exploring places that I have always dreamed of going to, but I will also be able to continue to learn and earn college and high school credit in a way that works best for my experiential mind as well as further heal the remaining symptoms of my concussion through community service and daily life. Roaring Canyons Semester will take place on the Green River that runs through Colorado and Utah's canyons. By canoe, we will embark on a 700 kilometer white water paddling and canyoneering expedition, bringing us through the heart of America's Southwest. As we travel through the land, we will learn about the environment that we will be surrounded by day and night, and the people and animals that once lived there. By making a contribution, you will not only be supporting me in my journey, but you will also be supporting Kroka Expeditions as I will be presenting 10% of each donation to the organization to contribute to their scholarship funds. This will help make this opportunity viable for many future students. For more information about Kroka, you can visit www.kroka.org","June 28, 2019",$260,"$4,000 "
Jack Elliman ,"Vernon, BC",Community & Neighbors,"(photo by www.lianneviau.com & www.BrainGarden.ca - Model - Nicole Rich - Summerland fire 2018)The Wildfire Prevention & Education campaign by www.BrainGarden.ca  THE FUNDS GENERATED THROUGH THIS FUNDRAISER WILL GO TOWARDS WILDFIRE PREVENTION & EDUCATION BY PROVIDING POCKET ASHTRAYS TO SMOKERS & EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE DANGERS OF CARELESSLY DISCARDED CIGARETTE BUTTS.From 2007 - 2017, fire suppression costs in Canada have ranged from $500 million to $1 billion a year. The 2017 wildfire season was the most destructive and expensive in the province’s recorded history. It cost B.C. more than $560 million to battle 1,351 different fires that burned through an area of 12,164 square kilometers. When you start adding up the numbers (including the other provinces such as Alberta) the numbers are staggering. Fighting wildfire is costing the taxpayer billions, not to mention the loss of tourism revenue & adverse health effects of poor air quality.Hi, my name is Jack Elliman (AKA The Butt Boss) & that is just over 170 lbs of cigarette butts outside my house. The team at Brain Garden & I are committed to reducing wildfire & pollution by educating the public on the dangers of cigarette waste while providing convenient, effective, & top quality litter reduction tools & services. And we're darn good at it too! Results guaranteed.Over the past 6 years of extensive market research/educational outreach, we have found that people don't want to litter their cigarette butts & if provided with a convenient tool that works, they WILL use it.  Our flagship product is The Pocket Ashtray ... A reusable, flexible, air-tight pouch made of recycled materials that suffocates smokables & traps odour inside (the main two reasons people litter their butts) Smokers can simply drop in their lit butt, & snap it shut. No need to stub, the butt will be extinguished safely. Our harm-reduction tool has been extremely successful selling over 150 000 units around the globe in 2018 alone to many fire departments, multiple cities, a BUTT load of music festivals, businesses, cleanup/ocean protection groups, non-profits, & anyone else who wants to help reduce the devastating effects of cigarette waste.A short list of some of our favorite collaborations/success stories to date ...

It featured beautiful art by the one & only Simon Haiduk, drew attention to the BC Wildfire hotline (1 800 663 5555) & included a devastating fact ""From 2007 - 2017 fire suppression costs in Canada ranged from 500 million to 1 billion a year"" (Click THIS to view the pic or see below)(Simon Haiduk Wildfire Prevention & Education Pocket Ashtray)Now we are taking it to the next level ...PRIMARY USE OF FUNDS ...We are currently raising funds (via this Go Fund Me campaign & by recycling cigarette butts) to produce the next Wildfire Prevention & Education Pocket Ashtray that we will distribute to smokers across Canada (mostly the driest/most at risk zones during wildfire season)  ... and the best part ... THE POCKET ASHTRAYS WILL BE FREE! Brain Garden will contribute financially & will help pay for at least 30 000 Pocket Ashtrays when we reach our goal of just over $13,000. This number includes the wholesale cost of the Pocket Ashtrays & the Go Fund Me fees.This design will have art contributions from multiple Canadian artists volunteering their time.

GYROWIND is ""not my first rodeo"" building small micro wind systems, I have designed and built a couple of system before that licensed to other companies, the past few years. :) Check out the mechanical power field test performed in June 2012 Research Team Darwind5 Field Test  (voice over says 2011, that was a Phd mistake ;) )Your funding  help will see GYROWIND realize the goal of Home Power Sovereignty without tax payer subsidy, and help pave the way for anyone to acquire power sovereignty off-grid at  really low cost to charge batteries powering their home, small business or cottage, with great reliability and performance,  without having to worry about selling power to or buying power from the grid.As an independent designer,  your help is more than  greatly appreciated, it's essential to finally solving the problem of low cost home power off-grid, without having to really on a tax payer subsidy to make your power generation and storage  project pay for itself in just a few years.Thanks for reading about this project!I hope you will checkout the details below, and see your way to help make GYROWIND a reality. :)Rob********************************************A little bit about me, I have been on a personal, self education  journey, ""learning mainly by doing"" in industry starting with  programming for early PC LANS and relational data bases for ERP and CRM systems used in small business, designing and selling factory floor networking, installing AutoCAD systems in the early 80s, designing and selling  corporate hi speed and WAN networking,  driving QA & Release management mobile development, designing &selling mobile and DC Server security solutions, and the last 10 years working largely as an independent contract for hi-tech and licensees of my wind powered generator. designs. Way back in high school I studied mechanical drafting, and a good thing I did. :)I am self taught on CFD, mainly Qblade, and on the parametric 3D modeller & FEA simulator & Mesh Generator called FreeCAD. I am no stranger to banging metal and cutting, bending, covering and drilling things in the shop.  Much of my early Aeronautics knowledge I obtained via my father,  Captain(retired)  G. A. Reive RCAF, Chief Air frame Engineer for Heavy Transport Aircraft at Air Transport Command , Trenton, ON, Canada active 1945-1983. Today I currently  help  three early startup companies design solutions and land those first big deals via technical consulting to become quickly self funded. (Codescoop, Leapwork, Cloudprox) On my own time, I work on GYROWIND and TWINDPower.Why? Because someone has to do it for the masses out there, as they are the ones, you and I,  who need cheap off grid power and a way to Do-It-Yourself at really low cost, without any special tools, using regularly available local materials and parts.

GYROWIND is the end result of working on FreeCAD and QBlade the last 10 months on and off part time to create a sound, super low cost  design I am now comfortable building (by hand) and putting my name on it. So think Canadian design with innovative American manufacturing partners, savvy ""Friends of"" financial supporters (some of them in Europe, Canada and Brazil as well) who believe in me,  and decent US parts supply.So read on to find out more, hopefully you see the GYROWIND cause is worthy and will drive the TRUE cost of micro wind down to where it should be,Main Use of Funds: Acquire Rotor Blade Connector MouldsI am raising money on  gofundme to  first, pay for 3D printed rotor blade module connector molds which will help me make  the first few sets of low cost connectors for new  low cost rotor blades for my newly  designed, low cost GYROWIND wind powered generator. The money I raise from gofundme will be used to order 3D printed moulds from a commercial 3D part printer in the USA, which will then allow me to pour and cure the first 36- connectors by hand for the first system to be included with the first 18 or 20 system kits of GYROWIND GYROWIND Connectors shown without Rotor Modules Mounted on the Exoblade spar and rod pairs.There are two single(1) section end connectors and two(2) dual section middle connectors per half (1/2) rotor blade, which means a single GYROWIND system has 4 connectors per half blade, with ten(10) half blades per systems requiring 40 connectors. Dual section connectors are about 9 inches wide (230mm) and at the widest point  about 1.5 inches thick (38mm) and  about 2 inches (50mm) tall.As a result it will cost some 3D Part Printer time ( hourly charges) and reasonable amount of nylon material  to print these low volume production connector moulds, designed with with two female top and bottom clam parts  and internal male plug parts. As a result expect 3D Printer Part Service Charges to be about  $10,000 I will be acquiring six pairs of mould sets,  to last  approximately 360 removals (60 per parts per mould pair),  enough mould durability to create 18-20  production kits before the plastic moulds wear out out.$10,000/20 units means a $500.00 surcharge per system to cover the cost of these moulds for the first 20 units., which have a limited production life of about 80  ""part pulls"" if handled carefully.Nylon or Plastic formed Moulds wear out when you  use metal  or hard plastic separation pry tools to first separate the mould halves top and bottom away from the connectors, after they have partly cured (usually 4 to 8 hours with new  ""Cold"" poured plastic mixes), and then pull out the male plugs (which create the rod, spar and air hole passages inside the connectors) to remove the single piece formed connector.  In variably the pry tools cause nicks and burs to form which will scratch the exterior of the connector part surfaces and edges, yielding a part which itself becomes susceptible to  nicks which can encourage water incursion, and some times ice formation which ill expand and make the nick larger over time, creating a drag effectConnector Production will look like this, using a day time and overnight cure, a daytime cure to create green parts ready to be pulled, essentially using a  set of  two pour/cure cycles per day after the first day: (Assumes 3 end ""single"" connector moulds and 3 Middle ""dual"" connector moulds) Day                1          2          3              4           5    Ends              6        12       12            12          12Middles       6        12       12           12           121/2 Blade   1.5   3/4.5  3/7.5     3/10.5  3/13.5   Full Blade   .75    2.25   3.75      5.25        6.75 System        NA      NA    NA          1              Next SystemSo production is slow, in this first build phase, with 1 set of full connectors  for entire GYROWIND  system produced every 4 days using the more expensive and slower cold pour method.I expect  five(5 ) Systems/Month of the GYROWIND to be produced initially, which is more than enough to get started., This means the  low production plastic mould life, given the pairing count and rate of production, will be fourth months.I also have to mix connector material twice a day really small amounts to economize, because once mixed, you cannot store and re-use any excess. A Note on Connector Reliability:Also a swelling and separation effect can occur from plastic pores being exposed and ""absorbing""  water, effectively reducing the durability  and useful duration of the part  by  creating irregularities  in the fit between connector and rotor blade surfaces (gaps, caused by  non-uniform connector bulges), and in some cases bigger  and more expensive rotor blade damage, can occur should the rotor module be dislodged by a debris strike  or  more likely  successive wind accelerations , all because the connector fit has become  loose and compromised, starting with a simple  external surface nick in the connector.Use of donations above our soft target:  Durable Molds to Go FasterIf I raise additional money from the gofundme campaign this money will be put towards more durable, but more expensive  injection mould which will cost approximately US $ 30,000 to US $50,000.  Other Use of Funds: Build the Field Test GYROWINDThe other US $5000.00  raised on minimum gofundme target will pay for building the first few complete systems target at 3 systems, one field test unit, and two  maximum contributed signed reward systems (more information forthcoming) :- poured plastic materials, mixed at room temperature, and- mold release, so the parts can be extracted easily, as well as- water jet cut sheet materials, pipe and tube,  - off-the-shelf parts (Generator Set) and- sheet metal hand sheer cut parts to  form cowling, cap, hubs, - plywood  for the flywheels inside the top & btm cowlings and- HDPE 'puckboard' used in raceway & sidewall construction and,- attachment hardware and adhesives (tape and glue and,- Aluminum ext. shaft and lighting rod tube and ground cable and,- 3X Genset Pivoting Bracket and slide pad and,  -3X Driven Wheel rubber Tire and Hub  pairs and,- related shop time service charges to get these parts cut to size and,- Setup of the website and online store for GYROWIND and,-creation of packaging, documentation and instructional  installation and maintenance video to be hosted on the website.Money received from gofundme above our software target:My Mid term goal: Under $2.00/Watt installed as TWINDPowerMy  mid term goal for  any additional  money raised on gofundme above our software target  is to source injection moulded connector parts in volume  so I  can make available single GYROWIND DIY Kits in volume quantities at a really low price of US $2495.00. This is US $2.00/Watt for the turbine and a good start.Making a Big installed US $2.00/W difference requires TWINDPowerHowever, to really make a difference to the consumer home, small business and cottage market, I am working on getting the  GYROWIND system kit price lowered to $1.00 Watt for the GYROWIND  DIY kit as by making GYROWIND part of the larger  power output TWINDPower System. TWINDPower  is designed to use two GYROWIND Turbines rotating in opposite direction of one another, sharing the same Tower Stand and Wind Acceleration Vane mounted 20% lower, yet capable of more than  doubling the AEP Annual Energy Production with a 50-65% savings on the shared stand and vane costs.The TWINDPower system is designed to more than double the effective  capacity factor of a GYROWIND subsystem, by accelerating the speed of the flow through the turbine on average by 1.8, while keeping both rotors in the flow with a downstream yaw mechanism which is highly responsive.  We expect TWINDPower using two GYROWIND rotors to deliver a installed US $ 2.00 Cost/Watt capability which will be 2X better than any other micro wind powered generator of any type.  More facts on future TWINDPower efforts can be found here on my wix site... TWINDPower A bit of background driving my dream for GYROWINDGYROWIND  is a culmination of  13 years of largely a personal effort  working part time,  which started in October 2006.  I have had good ""friends of"" financial support and did get a small grant from the NRC in Canada under the IRAP program to cover the wages and cost of the research ,and early field type build and test DARWIND5   team for six+ months between  November  2011 and June 2012.  To date, there has been about $350,000 hard cash poured into the project which has resulted in two earlier licenses,  neither of which is really in production yet, so its been a tough slug in these tough economic times.The result of this prolonged effort on my part is GYROWIND, a big price/performance/durability  improvement over existing small wind turbine designs offered by other  ""micro wind"" vendors and, also over my earlier Darwind5 and Harvistor designs which  I have created and licensed to other 3rd parties (Mobismart.ca and V3Wind.com) NEW TECH: 2X Better Price/PerformanceGYROWIND uses a new blade design I call ""Exoblade"" to dramatically lower the cost of both labour in Do-It-Yourself  ""DIY"" form and in really low cost use of sheet aluminium. As a result, GYROWIND, because of it's 33%  lower than average Cost/Watt for small wind systems,  pays back your investment in micro wind back really  quickly,  in 3 years typically, if the GYROWIND is sited properly  as an ""off-the-power-grid"" system charging batteries. Batteries from Nant Energy and others are now approaching US$ 100/kwhr of storage, so it's just common sense to re-equip your home , small business or cottage with GYROWIND , if you have decent access to wind most of the time. Even if the access is part time, combining GYROWIND with 2 kiloWatts of solar  panels is easy,  and likely  the best approach for marginal wind sites. (Otherwise solar only may be your only choice.)GYROWIND: NO GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY REQUIRED.GYROWIND does not require you jump ""through government hoops"" to get a tax credit. (Plus its likely you can only get the tax credit if you hook up your wind powered generator  and sell the power back to the grid). GYROWIND properly sited at the right height and distance away from  tree canopies and roof tops is proven to work today to get off-grid and start running you home, business or cottage from battery banks. The GYROWIND  Do-It-Yourself ""flat pack""  Kit will ship in a  2ft*2ft*4ft package and  will weigh approximately 50lbs for  shipping. GYROWIND Price TO START? online Direct ship $US 2495.00 FOB I will be selling the low cost GYROWIND DIY ""flat pack"" packaged system direct from my online site, shipped by our manufacturing partner for $US 2495.00 at the retailer ""buy price"" (think wholesale) until I get a worthy retailer on board. When that happens the price will go up to US $2995.00. I expect to have that done later in 2020.How long will it take to build? 2 Days or 2 Hours, priced differentlyA reasonably well organised beginner who has read the documentation, will be able to build all the components in one day  and assemble the GYROWIND system the second day, so 2 days total. :)  The GYROWIND can be assembled in a day from an easy to assemble set of ""flat pack"" parts kit requiring only a wrench set, a screwdriver, scissors, and optionally a hot glue gun using waterproof glue sticks.  2 Hour Assembly  Pre-Assembled Kit option:If you are an ""assembly only""  DIY type, I'll do most of the assembly for you, for a higher price of course.As a fast assemble and install option,  I am also organising with  our partner manufacturing and supporting a pre-assembled version of the GYROWIND which takes only 1 hour to simply assembly, with a parts return for manufacturing/material flaw warranty of 90 days return& replace policy, and 10 year normal operational use (Desert locations  are 5 years)to off the GYROWIND online for US $3495.00 in a highly pre-assembled kit form  fitted in a 3ft*3ft by 6ft container, with a speedy 30 minute assembly time.Setting up a Functioning GYROWIND Powered Generator:The GYROWIND, while curved in form like an ""Eggbeater"", is highly efficient and quiet in low mount, turbulent wind. GYROWIND is sized to connect to a 2KW input Missouri Wind and Solar  charge controller (or similar) connected to a battery bank  sized  to power a home, cottage or small business easily, and also work easily with solar panels.DIY Micro Wind with GYROWIND: 6 feet diameter by 12 feet tallThe GYROWIND DIY Kit is designed to  enable any handy person to hand form the rotor module sections out of standard, light weight sheet material (Aluminium 1.2 mm thick), each of which are closed with double sided tape on the trailing edge , where each formed sheet comes with double sided taped edge which fit into the connectors to form a 6 ft diameter and 12 foot tall Wind Turbine designed to work with Missouri Wind and Solar generator sets and battery charge controllers.  While the GYROWIND Model 1836 (1.8m diameter and 3.6 m tall) of 1.6 kiloWatt NP ""NamePlate"" power output maximal rating  is pretty big relative to an average sized human, one person can erect the 50lb GYROWIND system on a 12 m ( 39 ft)  or 15 m (50ft) pole with an intelligent G/N ""Gravity Neutral"" pole tip up design and  approach secured with three to four guy cables mounted to three or four  ground stays  or, optionally  by using a  vertical G/N pole assist tool  to easily erect a ""stayless"" monopole solution from provides in MN, USA AMBOR Structures, who are experts in micro and small wind towers.  (Of course two people is always faster and safer.)Performance: Great Power Output in Low Mount Turbulent WindThe GYROWIND is rated for 1.6 kiloWatt power out put (Nameplate).  The GYROWIND  was designed and simulated on QBlade to have Coefficient of Power ""Cp"", which  responds immediately to convert wind power into rotational power across a wide range of Tip Speed Ratios, ""TSR"" which is the speed of the center of the rotor blade vertically, (our eggbeater tip) versus the speed of the wind, is a good thing, and such flexible conversion operation translates into really good Annual Energy Production ""AEP, making  GYROWIND great value for money. (Price/Performance) An efficient conversion rate Cp, typified by a ""flatter"" Cp ""power curve"" operating a high  Cp levels (over .3 versus the .59 Betz law govering maximum energy extraction from the wind)  over a broad range TSRs means when the wind gusts, or slows down , the GYROWIND will still convert the kinetic flow energy produce by that wind speed into useful rotational power (torque), by virtue of the GYROWIND rotor blade telemetry (angle of attack and blade position) and Exoblade and airfoil geometry (the curve of the blade and shape of the airfoil used to generate lift, lead tip suction pressure differential, and reduction in drag). The torque curve of the GYROWIND, which I have labelled 1836  looks like this inside of Qblade in the top left part of the screen:Top left is the ""flatter "" desirable Cp ""Power Curve of GYROWINDAt the end of the day, Torque is everything in the  low TSR quite GYROWIND  design, you can see the Qblade predicted Torque curve and its related ripple at different speeds through different degree phases of rotation in the bottom right panel of Qblade below:A tour of Qblade and the 1836 Design Configuration options with 3rd party Alternators: Do it Your Way.., For those of you interested in a really low cost version of GYROWIND we plan to also offer a DIY Kit without Generator set.  This option means a savvy DIY can create their own version of GYROWIND adapted to their own generator choice. For Example the GYROWIND can be adapted today to use a standard small car alternator  form like the GM AC/Drlco (Delphi) form   sold on the Missouri Wind and Solar site. Simply add the bridge rectifiers  from Missouri Wind and Solar, or similar to convert the power output to DC, being careful t o specify the right DC cable gauge for the distance required to the next connection point.***********************************************************************MYTH BUSTING MICRO WIND'S TRUE COSTS:A bit of background on the TRUE COST of current small wind powered generator systems:Right now, all small wind turbines priced under 10 Kilowatt in rated power out put (typically measured in 11 or 12 meter per second wind speeds) have retail prices of US $ 3.00/Watt or more, and after installation on a tall tower can be US $ 5.00/Watt or more. This means it will take anyone buying current small wind turbines eight(8) years to get their money back, and it's likely the small wind turbine won't last that long as most blogs and forums on small wind report these systems requiring blade replacements by year six or seven, so add 25% of the orginal cost on top of your investment, which means you never get  the  return you were expecting .  Sure you can shorten the time to get a return getting a tax payer funded small wind tax credit to about 5 years, the real problem is these systems do not last very long.Also the real MAIN reason small wind turbines are so expensive is partly the labour content, but also the cost of creating the special laminated blades AND the cost of the tower  due to the height they need to function properly.Current small wind powered generators  really cost US$5.00/Watt or more to install  to get them to deliver the Annual Energy Production claimed by the vendors in kiloWatt hours of power produced.  These current systems  towers or poles are often the same price or more of what you would pay for just the wind powered generator portion of your installed system. So if you pay US$3000.00 for a 1.5 kiloWatt Vertical system which actually works as advertised producing 1000 Watts in 11 m/s wind flow , you can expect the tower to be at least US $3000 to get the system to work properly where the pole height will be 50 (16 m) feet or more. nb- GYROWIND being able to operate in lower mount positions relative to the above at 12 m (39 feet, the height of standard telephone pole)  in semi turbulent wind, yet still produce more power by as much as 35% annually over existing designs mounted at 16m (50 feet),  which is a huge price/performance advantage, in that tower or pole cost savings can be 25 to 35% alone, never mind the 35% extra kilowatt hours produced, in same site comparisons. Propeller  ""HAWT""wind powered generator sub systems are definitely cheaper, some advertised right now below US$2.00/Watt . However the also have shorter 3 or 5 year warranties and durability averags six(6) to seven(7) years.Noise and Reliability versus Annual energy Production:Pick Two , you will never get all three from a Propeller HAWT. HAWTs   produce more noise than the GYROWIND  because they operate at much higher rpm and tip speeds, typically  1200 up to 1600 rpm and TSRs over 8 and as high as 10,  before these HAWTS  furl out of the wind to protect the generator set from overheating and drying up the coil coating which can lead to catastrophic dust or water induced shorts and burnouts.More importantly  HAWTS in low mount heights and turbulent flow  do not produce much power, typically 35%- to 65% lower power output   because of turbulence, operating at low rpm, where power output is reduced due to laminar flow detachment (flow attachment smoothly over the entire blade ""airfoil shaped"" surface is needed in these HAWT designs to create sufficient lift which causes rotation) . To further reduce output, these  small HAWTS  are not able to quickly redirect into the flow when the wind direction changes which also seriously reduces AEP by 15%-35% , the typical drop in rpm observed in all such designs when the wind direction changes.These HAWT design shortcomings of laminar flow detachment and poor performance in flows with regularly changing wind directions at low heights are why all propeller ""HAWT"" micro wind vendors routinely require 60 ft, 75 ft and sometimes 90 ft towers to reach their advertised Annual Energy Production claims. These vendors make more money of the towers which are very often 115% to 150% the cost of the actual wind powered generator subsystem, which can really only operate properly in straight flows found at taller tower or pole heights.The end result is a US $ 2.00/Watt  (or less)  advertised HAWT  system after re-seller discount  really only operates at 500 to 600 Watts per hour on average in a lower mount site, which means the true cost really is a US $3.60 or even  US $4.00 Watt system  BEFORE the tower is purchased.If the HAWT offered  at US$1.00/Watt or less , expect to pay a lot more , 150% more than what you pay for the actual system for a really tall tower, in order to get into a straight flow all the time to get these cheap HAWT metal blade systems to work. You can erect a ""cheap"" tower made of metal pole sections,  tipped up on a G/N pole supported by guy  three or four wires,  however you will need three people to do that safely, will have to create the concrete anchors with the stay mounts to attach the cables , which means additional tower costs in concrete and related digging/mixing and pouring labour******","August 12, 2019",0,"$15,000 goal"
Michael Johnston ,n/a,"Medical, Illness & Healing","Hi, my name is Vitalie Bet.My story begins in Chisinau, capital Moldova – poor, but very nice country; on 8th of April, 1980.I was raised there and lived with my lovely family- father Nikolae, mom Tamara and elder sister Svetlana. We lived modestly, but fairly and we were really happy. My both parents were ordinary construction workers, but very nice, wise and loving people. From the young days I have been taught to be polity, health caring, people helping and wisdom searching man. Parents, despite the difficult life, have given me possibility to try different sports, as athletics, football, martial arts, etc. Sports and health care had become a habit, which was practice till this day.Then I have ended secondary school (1997), I understood that my time for helping parents came, while sister was continuing her learning. I have started to work as a waiter in different high level restaurants and night bars in Chisinau.By the year 2002 I understood, that to be a waiter is not a solution anymore, especially if thinking not only about helping parents, but building my own life too. Seeking for something more was too complicated in Chisinau- education was needed, but studying and not earning any income wasn’t possible.At that moment the idea of green card had come to my mind. I started to interest about Ireland and Canada. During few month of intensive search I have got job proposal in Kingscourt, co. Cavan, Ireland. It was a catering position in local take away and I grabbed this chance. By the way- I work there till now… As for any immigrant in foreign country, it wasn’t easy at the start, but I had clear goals and my family members, whom believed in me. Through the years I have found myself as chef, earned the respect and became one of the main persons in that take away, to whom anything can be entrusted.The same position I have gain in social life of the town. Irish people started to become my acquaintance and even friends. I started to now to whom it is needed to come for getting answers and to solve one or other problem. For immigrants I became a man to whom everybody can come, talk, solve problems or get advice on different issues- job, living-space, taxes or even mental questions. In 2006 I became a member of Kingscourt Community Development Association and get personally acquainted with Clifford Kelly. I felt as I’m growing and getting to the right place of my life. :)Of course I haven’t forgotten about my family. Through all the years we had a strong connection even than there was no possibility to come home once a year. In these occasions my sister had ended the studies for bio laboratory assistant and started to work, parents started to live a little easier, my salary grew in little steps. Slightly I got opportunity to come back home for such holidays as Christmas and Easter, which was sacred in our family and I understood it even better then.By the year of 2005 I have met Angelica- wonderful woman and my second half. Romance was floating in the ear and I can’t think about anything I would like to have more… Unfortunately in 2008 I got a punch from the life- my father has died from the stroke. It was really hard for me to live through this accident and I even don’t know how it could influence my future, if there wasn’t my lovely and caring life companion Angelica. I am really grateful to her and her understanding. At this moment it was clear, that we will become a family. And we did, and did it in the best way- up till know our acquaintance look at us as to ideal couple! We hadn’t opportunity (financial resources) to play wedding at the start, but that wasn’t really needed- we loved each other and whole world was under our foot. In the same year 2008 our daughter Alisa was born and happiness spread. I have got new goals and priorities- raising the kid. We started planning new home, holidays across the Ireland and other activities- sports, education, etc. From this perspective Ireland gave also good opportunities- cheap, but wonderful traveling across the country, by the ocean and mountains. Fresh air, fascinating nature and mystical history- it’s more than needed to rest and grow with the family. At home new rights were applied. In 2010 second child was born- son Arthur.In 2011 with all the family we went to Chisinau and played the wedding. At last I could officially call upon my lovely and loving wife. And again- life started to seem perfect… :)It continued up to October, 2014. I had standard physical examination of my stomach- gastritis was everything I was worrying about. For unknown reasons doctor asked me if I don’t mind that they will take biopsy additionally. As the result stomach cancer was revealed… From the first view it did not seem to be very critical issue. Chemotherapy was planned and done. On the March, 2015 I have become volunteer for researches of stomach cancer. For April my surgery was planned in St. James’s Hospital, Dublin- cancer with 75% stomach removal and it’s rebuilding . Yes, it should be something uncommon and I would have to learn to eat from the scratch, but without the cancer. With this thoughts and strong will I had met my 35th birthday on Wednesday, 8th of April.On Friday, 10th of April, I taken surgery, but the result was completely wise versa. Not only cancer wasn’t removed, but it was revealed that it is already in the early fourth stage with metastases to the intestine and nothing can be done in Ireland at all.Everything what is left now is the hope that something can be done in other countries as Germany, Israel or USA, but huge amount of money (~100 000 Euro), which my family don’t have and haven’t in any moment through all life, needed fast. I have anything to do more than ask humanity a favor and let me have a chance not leaving this world and continuing my story. Any help- information, advice, this information sharing and especially financial (any sums); would be appreciated.From my side I guarantee that all funds gathered will go only for fighting with stomach cancer- mine and, if any funds left, all other (left funds will be transferred to cancer societies- Irish Cancer Society or any other you prefer). All, whom will take a part in this activity, will get a e-letter of thanks-certificate- symbolic memory of your humanistic and descent step.  Also I will continue this project, I have started for myself, to help all the others, whom got in similar situation.Also I and my all family will pray God for wealth of all who have donated or in any other way will help me. We will be thankful for You all our life.Thanks in forward,Vitalie Bet","April 13, 2015","€3,107","€100,000 "
Go Greens Killaloe Hills ,"Killaloe, ON",Business & Entrepreneurs,"The project needs $20,000 to realize the dream of year-round harvest in Eastern Canada using geothermal heating.Our salads have been appearing on Ottawa tables and beyond for thirty-five years. Every Wednesday we deliver a van full of salad to Ottawa from the middle of May until the second week of November.  Our clients include Bridgehead, Rainbow Foods, the Byward Fruit Market and others. We grow one hundred different kinds of greens during the season and our salad bags include edible flowers, herbs and a great variety of greens—a very healthful meal. And many appreciate the greens in smoothie mixes as much as we do.When we arrived in the Wilno Hills thirty-eight years ago, we had no infrastructure and one half-inch of topsoil, most had eroded to the bottom slopes. Using cover crops, compost from manures, seeds,wildflowers, leaves, herbs and grasses from the surrounding area  we helped nature create a living soil that is now two to three feet deep.My son Aaron, head farmer for the past 12 years, was three months old, when we were shown our new home. Passing a perfect stand of trees protecting the area where our future gardens would be, we visualized a hill covered by a continuous greenhouse. How would that be possible with our snow-loads here? The answer came with observation and experience. Connecting the outside environment with the inside greenhouse by insulating around them and stopping cold water from entering thus draining heat. In the end we have what is termed a “living roof”.The ProjectSix-inch pipes will change the area both cooling in summer and heat for extreme weather for our cold hardy crops. When we seed in higher light levels in August they can hold until harvested as in a living fridge. Air moved through the ground supplies the minimal temperatures plus the airflow to prevent molds and other stagnant-air problems while drawing in fresh air and CO2 through previously buried earth tubes. These are connected with the higher greenhouse, a thermal flywheel with a concrete and stone wall in the center. Twelve inches of river rock retains heat while moving air through the wall and around the greenhouse.Much of this work is completed and has been producing great results for many years. Fresh funds are needed now to purchase and bury the last series of pipes, to insulate and install fans for airflow. Examples of other growers using earth tubes for heating and cooling can be found on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD_3_gsgsnk) . None of them insulate between greenhouses, as we plan to do, and they still grow tropical plants in places like Korea and Nebraska in winter. We have no desire to grow bananas or pineapples—fresh, cold hardy greens all winter are our dream.The People – The HouseI am a many-generation farmer and all three sons have done an apprenticeship and are involved in the project in their own ways. We have four part-time employees who will appreciate the ability to turn up the heat while working in the greenhouses.We make basic wages, as our employees, while investing much of the income into maintenance & expansions. We need additional funding of twenty-thousand dollars for ground work, material, cost and additional labor, when indispensable, to complete the next phase on the “living roof”. We plan on blogging weekly or monthly depending on the season and will be posting results and sending winter salad to a location close to you soon! Bridgehead, Rainbow Foods, Byward Fruit Market and chefs have been carrying our salads for many years May through to November.The lack of year round local environmentally friendly farming leave us all contemplating what we can do to help encourage positive change. Producing food in the winter months using manual energy to run fans is something we can all contribute to.Any donation towards the project is appreciated. Let’s work together to ensure local greens are available through the winter. We would enjoy having salad dinner and a tour with donors should you be interested. We encourage you to share this project with all your salad loving friends and family.

The opportunities that lie in
America are endless within the creative industries and regarding the Degree
programs in dance in LA, is on a completely different standard  in comparison to what is offered in Degree
programs here in the UK. 
However the major setback is how
expensive the tuition and accommodation fees are, especially in my
circumstances where i cannot, alone, provide the finances to accumulate to
these figures. This is why I am not ashamed to ask for help as i know there are
amazing and generous people that can support me. 
The tuition fees per year are:
$31,000, equivalent to £20,000. In addition the accommodation fees per year
are: $6,700, which is equivalent to £5,000. 
At the moment I have been looking
for alternative funding such as sponsorship's through entrepreneurs or
different funding opportunities that various companies/organizations may offer.
But unfortunately none have replied back with a successful solution.

This is where you, my friends
come in!
If I were able to receive
assistance in my funding, it would be appreciated so much as I feel this school
can help increase my creative skills as an individual but to also give back to
my community as well, when i return.
""It takes passion to make
dance your life, but to make it your career you need more. You need discipline,
endurance and a total awareness of your body mechanics.""
This is where I feel AMDA plays a
major part, because they offer a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Dance Theatre.
By looking at the sample curriculum the subjects offered suggests you must be
prepared for a laborious 4 year course. The study demands a lot physically of a
student as it can increase my classical technique and perfect my focus and
diversity, through the variety of dance styles that are taught. By researching
on the various Alumni's that have graduated from AMDA, I have seen and heard
from these students completing this program, they become capable,
multi-disciplined performers. AMDA's creative and immense curriculum also gives
you the solid innovative foundation necessary to flourish in the performing
arts. I am truly excited for the day I actually spend my first day at AMDA's
extraordinary facility and meet the amazing mentors and faculty members that
help guide students to finding their personal career paths. And help students
through the foundation of the profession and inspire students to conceptualize.
But this can only be possible
through your generous contributions. I hope you can understand and relate how
passionate and hungry I am for such a great opportunity such as this and I can
only believe that you guys can understand and help push me to get there.I have now been placed in an article published in my local newspaper if you'd like to read the article, don't hesitate to click on the link below;http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/news/islington_teen_picked_from_1_000_s_for_famous_new_york_dance_school_1_2207712

Kevin Reid ,"Guelph, ON",Business & Entrepreneurs,"Hello. My name is Peterson Mbessa. I am seeking your help in my efforts to raise myself and my extended family out of the dire poverty of daily life in Malawi, Africa. I am a hardworking 28 year-old resident of Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi. I intend to use your generous support to purchase a used minibus to become an owner/operator in the minibus transportation industry that provides the only public transportation for people in and around Lilongwe. The minibus business:In Malawi, the minibus business can be profitable, particularly in Lilongwe. The industry is growing every year because no public transport system exists in this city of over 1 million people. Government policies are deliberately geared towards promotion of minibus services to support public transport. The demand for minibus services to carry workers to and from their workplaces is very high.About me:I am the first born son in my family. I have five full brothers (Botus, Dickson, Mike, Yankho and Emmanuel) and four full sisters (Chinsisi – who has autism, Tadala, Siphiwe and Catharine) from my mother Gracie. There are another 12 half-siblings from my father Wilmont. As the eldest son, I have become the primary supporter of this large extended family from the income I generate from doing piecework. I completed public school but could not finish high school due to my family’ inability to pay school fees and buy the uniforms which are mandatory in Malawi’s public school system, and also so I can support my brothers and sisters. I speak Chichewa and English.  Like many Malawians, I am a natural born entrepreneur. I rent a small plot of land to grow maize and sweet potatoes but almost no rain in the past two growing seasons caused the sweet potatoes to fail and there was not even enough maize to even feed my family. I receive a small income from working as a part-time driver and “fixer” for Dr. Wilson Jere, a Head of Department at Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources. I can occasionally supplement this income by driving international visitors to the university throughout Malawi. I am also sometimes hired to drive imported vehicles from Tanzania into Malawi. These jobs have given me the experience I need to import a vehicle and become an owner/operator of a minibus service in Malawi. The business plan:I am fortunate to have the full support from my friends and advisors, Dr. Wilson Jere of Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Malawi) and Dr. Kevin Reid of the Ontario Commercial Fisheries’ Association (Canada), to start my own business. We have prepared a business plan to establish Mbessa Minibus Ltd., which is aimed at generating profits to support my family. I am seeking US$10,000 to purchase a good used minibus and start off my minibus service. Mr. Peterson Nachanje, a senior Accountant at Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Malawi) who also runs a transport business, will be offering financial assistance to Mbessa Minibus Ltd. All of the above have agreed to offer their professional advice free-of-charge. The business plan is available upon request.It is my dream that Mbessa Minibus Service Ltd. will allow me to raise my brothers and sisters to afford an education, healthy food, and increase the quality of their lives in one of the world’s poorest countries. The company will also promote green initiatives by following proper maintenance and oil/fuel disposal procedures to avoid damaging the environment. Thank you so much for taking an interest in my story.Peterson Mbessa","September 5, 2016","$2,025","$10,000 "
Andee Bulma Wiedeman ,"Vancouver, BC",Education & Learning,"
Thanks so much for reading! My name is Andee and I have been advocating sustainable partying for the last 7 years. From dance floor cleanups, public outreach, and green volunteer time all the way to starting my NFP re:FILTER, I am always expanding my knowledge of waste to help better educate our communities on this issue.This year, my team of 4 has been awarded 2 Art Grant tickets to the BC Music Festival Bass Coast. Thanks, Bass Coast! While this is incredible news, we have to pull together funds for the actual creation of the art itself. We are building a SIX BIN PARTY DISPOSAL SYSTEM. With the help of Devin, Jayden, and Mar, the idea is to create very simple waste streams for party waste; highly visible to the guests of the event. The bins will be filled with:1. Paper (Polycoated) Cups & Sleeves2. Plastic (clear/plant based) Cups & Lids3. Plastic (clear) Bottles4. Whip-It (Steel) Cartridges5. Glowsticks6. Beverage (Aluminum) CansOne of the most unfortunate truths of the music festival experience is that we rarely pack out what we pack in. So many items come boxed, or wrapped, and then individually wrapped within the packaging. Fast fashion, cool accessories, silly toys and glowsticks often end up dead in the dirt early Sunday morning...Imagine yourself standing with an empty can of coconut water and a food soaked take out container after a long night of dancing. You approach the festival's bins, you see the 5 different streams of waste the festival accepts, you read the signs. The signs aren't incredibly clear to you, your blue bin system at home is difficult enough already; you look into the bins to see what other people have done, but it seems they may have been confused as well. Is my take-out container garbage or compost? Is my can depositable or recyclable? You start to feel silly, you're tired, and you toss. You don't remember what you chose once you're back at camp.Our art installation, ""Waste Coast"", is a light up SIX (6) BIN system that is intended to inspire people to take extra time and care with their waste. By educating and rewarding the guests of the festival, we believe that we can make a difference in both the festival and the communities' the guests return home to. With 6 very clear streams (clear bins made from PVC polycarbonate roofing) and 6 reactive strips of LED light in each bin, our installation becomes interactive by inviting the user to drop the piece of waste in the correct bin. The reactive strip will light in response to waste being placed. There will be signs describing where the waste goes, how it gets there, and what happens to it once it arrives. THE SCOPE of ""WASTE (MISPLACED) COAST""PROJECT TOTAL: $1,070.73 + Safety net ~$130MATERIAL COST BREAKDOWNRGB LED LIGHTS (5) Waterproof RGB flexible 16.4ft LED light strip kits = $139.95ARDUINOS, SENSORS AND WIRINGArduino 2 x $12.00 5 x $2 + $5 shipping = $15 Total$39.00 IR Sensors1 - 3 So we need 241(5 pack) x $12 19 x $0.33 + 30 shipping = $31 Total$48.27WIRE$23.00 for 6 x 30ft spoolsLED CLIPS30pcs 4pin = $6.5 SHRINK WRAP150 pcs - 6 size$15.00MOSFETs3/bin x 6 = $185 pack = $12.00 1.30 / 10pc = $1.30 Total$22.00POWER SUPPLY 2x AC power to 12V = $80.00PVC PANELS(8) polycarbonate roof panel clear [26” x 6ft] $122.80STEEL FRAMING Steel - hot rolled angle structural: (3) 96” [1.5 x 1.5 x .25] $105.83Steel - hot rolled tube square structural: (4) 96” [1 x 1 x .125] $103.66Steel - hot rolled tube square structural: (2) 96” [1 x 1 x .1] $63.04Steel - hot rolled tube square structural: (2) 96” [1.25 x 1.25 x 0.125] $75.40Steel - hot rolled tube square structural: (1) 96” [1.5 x 1.5 x .125] $55.41Total steel: $403.34PVC TUBING (13) Furniture grade white [1” x 5ft] PVC = $77.75Adaptors and Tees = $32.35 Total: $110CANVAS UMBRELLAbeige/white roll of canvas unprimed [6yd x 24”] $42.37(1) thread white cotton $15Total: $67.37 All of our plywood will be sourced from worksite cuttings and painted through the recycling depot paint program.We will be wiring our own LED strips from buying large strings at a time and cutting to size; instead of using battery power we will be bringing our own extension cords that we will dig trenches for to attach to local power. The best price is on amazon - we will be requesting their low waste packaging and purchasing from a warehouse in Canada. We will buy our wire for the sensors and arduinos from a local source. We will be using as much worksite sourced steel as possible for framing, and all of our fasteners will be sourced from our local MakerLabs scrap offers. Our umbrella to protect from rain will be made to reflect the LEDs below, to capture the full potential of lights used. The reflective material will be sourced from the lining of flat screen tvs through local electronics recycling. All of our clear bags (made from biodegradable plastic) for holding the waste will be rinsed (if necessary) and used again upon maintenance of bins.This project will be built in small portions, to lay flat for packing and constantly be broken down / rebuilt as strong as before. We plan to display it in many different places and have sustainability in mind at the very core of the waste theme. With this as a personal goal, a group goal, and the art’s goal - we will absolutely be sourcing as much of the other materials as possible through recycling/upcycling.That being said, we need funds to gather these items - specifically the lights, sensors, arduinos and canvas. The sooner we have the funds, the better! I'm sure you've heard it before: EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS. From a $5 donation to a $50 donation, it is going to add up!

Johnathon Straker ,"Saint Catharines, ON",Business & Entrepreneurs,"Hi my name is John and I am raising money for my startup business Simple Thrift, located in St Catharines, Ontario, Canada. 

Environmental impact is real and is getting worse.

Clothing- The average person throws away 81lbs of perfectly recyclable and reusable clothing every year which is almost 10 MILLION Tonnes of clothing sent to the landfill every year in North America. 

Toys- It is estimated that 90% of toys are made of plastic, once toys are used and/or broken they get sent to the landfill which is a lot of plastic that doesn't need to be tossed. 

Books- It is estimated that 640,000 Tonnes of books are sent to the landfill annually which is roughly 320 MILLION BOOKS that aren't given the chance to be recycled or reused. Why? Apparently from my research, people are just too lazy to pack the items and lug them to the donation center. 

And that's where Simple Thrift comes in. All you have to do is Call, Text, Email and we provide FREE donation pickups at your door, all you have to do is request a pickup and leave the items outside. 

The items collected are then evaluated for resale and listed online, items that don't pass evaluation are recycled properly.

Best part is my friend is the founder of the Bridges Support Services Charity located in St Catharines, Ontario, Canada which helps children and the elderly with disabilities, (formally the Bridges for Autism Charity), in which a percentage of sales are going straight to the Charity.

You can visit the site here: https://www.bridgessupportservices.ca/ 

Why am I raising money? I need help funding to build a proper selling website.

Benefits of the business are;

Standing up for I believe in; being the change I wish to see.Read more about why I walk in my story and my action plan.My StoryThe Struggles from The BeginningFrom the age 15 to the age 24 It was an exhausting battle with my Mental Health.My struggles with poverty in the past, started as a child raised on welfare.I am physically capable to work and when I do, I work hard for my money but still struggle with low income due to my mental health issues.On December 21, 2019 I will be the age of 27. Although I am much wiser and happier; I still struggle from the effects of my past, the poverty, the trauma, the loneliness, abuse and self hate.Within the last eight years, I've had dozens upon dozens of job, just trying to follow the way of life, the social norm. None of them worked out. I never felt that I belonged, that I was wasting my talent (whatever it was). I started two business and a non profit; ideas that never succeed. My option? To return to minimum wage jobs I never enjoyed. I've only been employed for 2 weeks to 6 months maybe a year, before voluntary leave because I could not bear working a job I didn't like, just to live pay cheque to pay cheque, to survive. I though there was no industry I would enjoy working in. That is until 2019, I found the only job I have ever liked in Silviculture ... Tree Planting. My Year as a Rookie Tree PlanterDuring my rookie year tree planting, I learned what hard work was, the value of a dollar but most importantly I learned how to be alone. It challenged me, forcing me to deal with me. Leaving the cache on the block, walking into my piece, it was me and only me. Although it taught be to be alone, I struggled. Almost quit four times due to my mental healthIn saying, I came along way, and reached a personal best of 1770 trees planted in one day, and by the beginning of June. I knew if I kept it up and just pound by the end of the season I'd hit 2k ! Unfortunately, after the spring plant, and a tough battle with myself. I ended my contract. I was going through a lot of personal stuff that made me angry, I couldn't focus anymore. I realized that I needed to focus on myself for the rest of the year, to work on my well being so I can plant a full season next year. My Future as A Tree PlanterFive months later, the struggle are here but I'm still here too. I've sought help, and I'm consistently talking about I feel and how I can find out what works for me. I've found that the very first thing we need to do is love ourselves and learn about ourselves. Sometimes you just have to cut out all the noise, and all the people.. discover who you really are. This expedition is my opportunity. As for tree planting, you can say it's safe I will return to the Silviculture! Ever since I left planting, I've been think about the day I return. I will be planting this season, I want to challenge my self even further and complete a full season.Returning home after the Season (four months ago) I loved living remotely in bush for two months, away from civilization, it help me focus on myself. So after tree planting I remained in BC for a month living in the bush of Smithers BC. Once money ran low, and the novelty of a small town life went away. My depression set in even more. I returned home to be with my family. When I returned home, I did start to focus on myself, focusing on where to stay, what could I do for work, fearing of failing back into night life, old relationships etc. However, these were things that made me in happy me. I went backwards instead of forward. I wanted a break from the work just to pay rent, the partying and drinking, the the men. What happen to the travel and adventurous. What about what o wanted to do. The only peace I had was sleeping in my tent, and i never consider myself homeless, as I enjoyed it. Living sustainable, nature at your front door. Nevertheless, my mental health worsen, when the money ran out and jobs where one of the lowest wages in the country, on top of balancing talking care of family and myself. I had no idea what to do. So i applied for EI. Little did I know where i quit my job in Ontario, a) i may not be approved for regular, so i applied for sickness benefits. After talking with a doctor he recommended that I didn't return to work until I seeked counselling. I attend a few session that month. After waiting two months, i got back pay in September, but by then bills where piled up. Just to learn, my recovery date is one month from away. Needing a break, I hopped on the bus to visit my friend in Ontario for two weeks. While I was up here is remembered my recovery date was coming up., I also remembered asking a Service Canada agent if i went to another province for a doctors note, would that be okay... she said yes, as long as i never left Canada. I seen a doctor a week to my visit on Ontario and he gave me one. Once submitted to Employment Insurance, I got a notification from EI saying that because I'm on ""vacation"". I never left the country nor moved to Ontario. I came just for a visit.What fueled my fire?The story continues the government ended up leaving me with no money and having to return to work with an illness. After all the stuggles with income support in the past (living in Ontario given only $601 a month to pay rent, and travel). Being denied twice for income support in Newfoundland because I made too much - no tbeven considering the bills I had to pay before applying. So applying for assistance was out of the question. I couldn't go through no more stressMy doctor said 95% of people hate their job.. I guess it's the way it has to be… or does it? Hoping to find the answers through therapy, I still have yet to get a call.So What Happen!?I cried. Of course, I cried. I felt like a loser already, now I was broke. I didn't know what I could do as I was tired of working in Toronto, tired of not focusing on me and my recovery. All I ever wanted to do is travel, go on a solo adventure; to let my soul breath, and my mind be free. I was about to give up, but I knew I could give up not on myself, so I just cried.I know about distress centers, however, they never worked for me as I felt they could never understand. I just wanted to be happy and not struggle. The Idea: A Walk to AwarenessA month ago, I had a  mental breakdown in my current Toronto home, my friend, Frances asked me, ""What are you hood at doing?"" wiping my tears, I chuckled, ""Being emotional…"" ""Standing up for what I believe in"" ""hands on work"" She then asked what makes you happy, you keep mentioned traveling"". I said, ""I do! And I love making a difference and sharing my voice"".A day later, I found out about my EI review, I wasn't getting any money. That same day my friend told me about the complications with her maternity leave. I was furious, so I said, f*CK this! And decided to forget my EI. Seasonal work was just 6 months away, Im in between finding myself and a job. I decide to do what I've always wanted.. travel and start fighting for better future, broke or not. I always dreamed about a live where I don't have to worry if I eat or pay rent, or what happens if I get ill. So what can I do!?...Walk!Why Walk?I walk and strike in support of the advocacy for a universal basic Income. So children growing up in poverty don't have to deal with so many struggles due to low income.I walk and strike for climate justice for a cleaner and green future, to spoke today's youth standing up for the earth.. I walk for positive solutions for mental health. I walk for m little brother, who cannot advocate for himself and for others who cannot do the same. For every person who has cried out and said why is life so f*cking difficult or ""why can't I figure this out"". The truth is life's difficult and no one has it figured it out. I'm walking and striking cause it's what I know best, what I loving do. I hope to make life a little more easier for myself and others. I'm tired of getting my heartbroken..not being strong enough to keep myself together. Afraid to be alone. It's now going to change. I walk for self awareness. I will be doing this in my way as it's a self searching/awareness. My own adventure. Not just about physical survival but mental survival: self care. I've learned you can find your place, your purpose and it may not be the traditional way. because it's your way. Just like me, it took me 5 years to realize that. I want everyone to live a prosperous and fulfilling life. Live outside of your comfort zone.. do what you never thought you would do. Don't be afraid to quit that job you hate.. don't be afraid to stand up for yourself and what you believe in. It may just be what you were looking for.This is not the answer to my mental health issues, I believe it will always be a struggle, and therapy is a great away to help solve and cope with poor mental health. This walk is a decision I made based on my passion for the earth, for humanity and for love. The walk will come to a end and I will return to working full-time, also working on my mental health, like many others. Nevertheless, I believe this journey is the one I've been waiting for, my chance to be the change I've always wanted to be and to really connect with different people across the country. An opportunity to learn about myself.My Action PlanDecember 2019 to May 2020:Walk to Tofino, British Columbia from Toronto Ontario.What is a walk to awareness' action?A Walk to mental health and self care awareness raising $2000 per charity for two charities in my home province, Newfoundland and Labrador; Stella'a circle and the Bay of islands Search and Rescue.

Viken Henning ,"Bowling Green, KY","Medical, Illness & Healing","My name is Ryan, and I'm trying to raise funds for my mother.Christal Breedlove has been having it rough since 2016.  That year she lost a kidney due to a blood-clot masquerading as a kidney stone; suffered her first heart attack, and then was found to have advanced (stage 4) cervical cancer.[This picture was take today, 09/29/19, at Bowling Green, KY, Medical Center.]Christal's first medical procedures started in early 2017.  She went through a rapid period of radiation and chemotherapy treatments, which proved to be effective on the cancer, but not on her health.  At the time her jobs' insurance coverage, through Cobra, was covering everything although the lack of ability to work started making money real tight for the family.Six months of being out of work and she was let go from her job.  We started paying the insurance out of our own pockets, which just tightened everything up even worse.  It was a constant battle between what we needed to survive and what we had to pay out to keep the medical expenses at bay.2017 saw a second set of chemotherapy treatments as well as two more, for a total of three, stints put into Christal's heart.  Her remaining kidney was also under constant testing, to make sure it could effectively continue to work as chemotherapy is very much a poison that the body has to flush out.The tumor, a massive growth that had pushed into Christal's vaginal wall, was effectively killed during that time.  Yet the risk of re-occurrence was such that the doctors decided that she needed a full hysterectomy.  The surgery took place in late 2017, and was a success.  Except the healing was slow, and required constant hospital visits along with those already scheduled to monitor for any more cancer.  This, as you might imagine, stressed our already limited funds as the co-pay on the insurance was rather substantial. In November of 2017, a new cancer growth was found in Christal's right breast while another was found in a lymph node in the left side of her throat.  A quick biopsy from both sites found that the cancer in her breast was breast cancer, but the cancer in the lymph node was the same cervical cancer we'd been keeping an eye on.A lumpectomy in December 2017 removed the low-risk breast cancer easily.  Her chemotherapy treatment for the cancer in the lymph node didn't start until February 2018 however.  Afterwards things seemed to settle down, and Christal even found work online, as a teacher doing online classes part time.  She also managed to get put on Disability Insurance, as both the radiation and chemotherapy treatments had all but robbed her of her mobility and physical strength.Eight months later saw Christal Breedlove complaining is bouts of dizziness, fainting spells, and fall-based injuries.  We had to take her to the ER because we couldn't figure out what was going on.  Fainting while on the toilet and getting stuck between the toilet and the right-side wall of the bathroom was not a fun experience.  It really scared the crap out of us, no pun intended.Imaging of her chest proved that nothing was wrong with her heart, although it did expose that several growths of cancer had formed in her lungs.  Another biopsy found that it was still the cervical cancer, so a new round of Chemotherapy was set up.  Only this one was based on a different series of chemicals.Yet before that could get started, the doctors requested approval from her insurance to do a CT scan of Christal's head.  Lung cancer wouldn't cause the fainting spells, as her lung capacity had yet to be diminished that much.  It took over a month before approval was granted.It was already 2019 by then, and what we found caused quite the horror in the family.  Several tumorous growths were found in her brain, including one right in the corpus callosum, which is the center of the brain that controls how and when the signals from the right-or-left hemispheres of the brain communicate with each other.  Another was in her occipital lobe, worsening her already bad eyesight.Add in the fact that she'd already suffered through Meniere's disease years ago, in which the nerves of the inner ear start to degrade or die, Christal's sense of balance was totally shot.  She could no longer stand on her own, go to the bathroom by herself, or even stand in the shower.Christal was put on steroids to control the swelling in her brain as she went through another series of chemotherapy.  The theory was that if the cancer in her brain was still cervical cancer, then the chemotherapy should be effective upon it just like the rest.  Yet this new mixture, a non-platinum based type, did not work at all.  It neither killed the cancer in her lungs nor in her brain.  Instead it started killing her red blood cells, causing Christal to become even weaker week after week.She ended up having to have blood infusions several times after the chemotherapy had run its course, but even today her ability to produce red blood cells has been damaged.  It was... it was horrific and hard.  Having to literally pick my own mother up just so she could stumble onto or off of the toilet, and having to wash her with a damp cloth because she couldn't sit in the bathtub.Christal Breedlove has always been a hardworking, no-nonsense, progress type of woman.  Her own mother had died in a car crash when she was still a teen, and literally raised her four younger brothers herself.  She finished high school, worked for Fruit of the Loom while they were still in Bowling Green, KY, got married, and lived her life.Later on she'd marry my father, start training to be an EMT, run a Dominos' Pizza store as a manager and driver, give birth to me and my younger brother, get divorced and move on with her life.  She spent years after that working as a cross-country freight truck driver, visiting nearly every state in the country and loving every moment of it.When our father dumped us on her when I was 12 years old, mom quit driving a truck and instead went to college.  She's worked in factories, restaurants, as a delivery driver and more.  She eventually got her Bachelors' in Biology, and started working at Western Kentucky University as a microbiologist, studying and working under professors and others.Christal got her Masters' Degree in Biology within a couple of years, and started working in biology labs across the state.  She specialized in waste water/drinking water testing, searching for E. Coli and other nasty bacterium, viruses, and parasites back when all of those people were getting sick from drinking contaminated water up in Canada and various US states.None of that matters anymore.  There's been too much damage, too much cancer for her to work properly anymore.  She had to have spot-Radiation to the tumors in her brain, as well as another round of chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy which still has yet to be finished, because of how sick it is making her now.On Tuesday, September 24th, 2019, Christal went in for another round of chemotherapy.  It was her first since three weeks previously, where she'd had to have another two pints of blood infused because her red blood cell count had dropped again.  While at the facility, and under supervision, she was escorted into the bathroom.  While waiting for more help to get her from a wheelchair and to the toilet, she suffered a blackout and a seizure.At the same time she coded, her heart and lungs no longer pumping or beating.  Three times, three times the doctors and nurses had to resuscitate her between then and the time ambulance got her to the ER of the Medical Center.  While in the ER she suffered a fourth seizure and coded, but each time they managed to bring her back.I personally had been at home, taking care of our old dog and doing the daily cleaning, chores, and cooking.  Her chemotherapy treatments take between 3 to 6 hours, so I'd already cooked dinner and was eating when my aunt showed up to get me.  No one was sure if Christal would wake up, if she'd survive the evening or night, or if she'd been dropped into a coma from which she may not wake up from.Nearly the entire family rolled out to be there and visit her.  Three of Christal's four brothers, several of their wives, and a whole bunch of kids crowded the ER waiting room for hours.  She finally started waking up during that time, but while responsive she wasn't really aware.  Her memories of that time are fragmented.She was moved into Step-Down ICU that night, and later moved to a private room.  Even now, while awake and conscious, her ability to retain memory is at least partially degraded.  At the same time, her doctors are searching for the reason while her seizures keep causing her to effectively die.  Thankfully they have her own a regiment of seizure prevention medication, which seems to be effective.[This picture was take today, 09/29/19, at Bowling Green, KY, Medical Center.]Now I'm here, asking for help.  I do not work, because I'm the only one here that can take care of my mother.  It is not a prestigious thing to admit, but that's the way it is.  Christal's husband does work, but he doesn't make enough to cover everything.  Her Disability income goes to paying for her insurance coverage and the house mortgage.Everything else is paid for out of Christal's part time work online.  The bills, food, gas, vehicle payments, internet, credit card payments... the overage for living is huge, and add in all the co-pays and how much medication costs and you all know that money gets tight.I, however, am not asking for help on any of that.Instead I'm asking help in covering Christal Breedlove's Insurance Deductible.  It's $5,000 (Five Thousand) dollars, USD.  We've yet to be able to pay it for the year, and without doing so we won't be able to keep it next year.Anything over that amount will be put to paying for co-pays, hospital visits, medication costs and other medical expenses.  Just being able to cover those would be a great weight off of our shoulders.  It's entirely too suffocating, truth be told.And that's me trying to keep this professional and not break down crying, sorry.A quick and dirty rundown of our monthly expenses are to follow.  I'm not currently able to get into the books to get the exact numbers, so excuse the imprecision.  Monthly Expenses:House Mortgage - $700Utility Bills - $300~$500Internet Service - $90Food Costs - $200~$400Vehicle Mortgage - $500Medical Expenses - Variable, $200~$400+Just at a minimum that's around $2,000 dollars a month.  Truth be told, it's probably more.  We all know how heating and cooling, either with gas or electricity goes up and down.  Our combined household income on the other hand is less than $2,100 a month.We have nothing in savings anymore, and none of us are illegible for loans or other financial assistance.  We have nothing left.  These long years have drained us of everything...Thank you, all of you whom at least read this far.  Thank you for at least caring, for someone whom you do not know and have never met, and probably never will.  And thank you, all whom donate.  This money will help me to take care of my mother, a woman I love dearly and I hate seeing being graded into such a state.Thank you all, and God bless you all.[This picture was take today, 09/29/19, at Bowling Green, KY, Medical Center.]","September 29, 2019",0,"5,000 $ goal"
Jenna Vandal ,"Winnipeg, MB",Community & Neighbors,"Between mid-July and mid-September 2017, Indigenous land defenders and allies defended a large aspen forest in south Winnipeg from being clear cut by a private developer, Andrew Marquess. Marquess acquired the public lands in a controversial 2009 land swap with the city. It was called the Rooster Town Blockade, referencing the nearby Métis community that was expropriated and demolished in 1960 to build Grant Park Mall and other developments. Key concerns included a violation of Métis and First Nations rights, destruction of rare animals’ habitats and endangered wetlands, and an overall lack of consultation, both with the surrounding community, First Nations and the Métis community to whom the land belongs to.The blockade was removed in September 2017 after a judge approved the developer’s request for an urgent injunction. Although the developer in his legal affidavit pledged to retain at least 5 acres of the existing forest as green space, to our dismay, he quietly cut down the entire forest in October 2018.The developer is currently suing 49 people for alleged participation in the blockade. It’s expected that they will be pursuing upwards of $500,000 in alleged damages.We’re going to keep fighting. Due to the generous contribution of the citizens of Winnipeg, many of the defendants have retaining legal counsel. Lawsuits are by nature very expensive and lengthy processes. It will cost us tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees over the years. But it’s a far cheaper option that facing the possibility of the plaintiffs winning on default. And in the era of so-called “reconciliation” between Indigenous peoples and settlers, we believe it’s the right thing to do.Please consider donating to this legal fund. Many of us are students and low-wage workers, so the prospect of paying hundreds of dollars out of pocket for a retainer is awfully intimidating. Every dollar counts enormously.Who we are: We are some of the 49 defendants named in the lawsuit launched by a Winnipeg developer who is seeking damages potentially in excess of $500,000 for alleged participation in peaceful protest against the destruction of forest and wetlands. We include students, retirees, Indigenous land defenders, low-income workers and environmentalists.Where we're from: Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The site that was defended was in River Heights, 5 kilometres east of Assiniboine Park at a place called Parker Wetlands.Your relationship to party: I am a Métis student who is also a defendant in the lawsuitHow the funds will be used: To pay for the significant fees associated with retaining legal representation by Winnipeg's GCH Law. The case itself could cost between $30,000 and $100,000 over the span of three to five years. The money is transferred to the Rooster Town bank account and immediately transferred to the law firm, which then places it in a trust fund that serves as the retainer for the collective defence. This is done via a password-protected e-transfer. There were no problems at all with the first transfer for the retainer.Miigwech/Marcii/Thank YouHere are some links to articles about the struggle, as well as a letter of support from the Manitoba Métis Federation, if you wish to learn more:An Indigenous Blockade in Winnipeg Is Halting Deforestation Efforts: https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/evdj3z/an-indigenous-blockade-in-winnipeg-is-halting-deforestation-effortsParker Lands consultations would give Métis a say on ancestral land: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/opinion-parker-lands-consultatioon-1.4221809Métis-Anishinaabe land defender establishes Rooster Town blockade in Winnipeg to protect wetlands: https://canadians.org/blog/m%C3%A9tis-anishinaabe-land-defender-establishes-rooster-town-blockade-winnipeg-protect-wetlandsCoverage of Winnipeg’s Rooster Town Blockade Reveals Media’s Anti-Indigenous Biases: https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/coverage-of-winnipegs-rooster-town-blockade-and-medias-anti-indigenous-biasThe Skoden Chronicles podcast: https://soundcloud.com/the-skoden-chronicles/episode-10-racism-and-the-mediaProtesters quietly leave Parker lands: https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/protesters-quietly-leave-parker-lands-444778673.htmlCity reviewing removal of last trees from forest on Parker Lands https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4862341Letter of support from the Manitoba Métis Federation sent to APTN:“The Manitoba Metis Federation respects Ms. Vandal’s right to protest the development of this area.From our preliminary research into this matter, it seems there may be legitimate concern regarding the approach of the developer in not fully following the correct procedure in the development. If this is the case, we would certainly share and express similar concerns as those of Ms. Vandal.We are led to understand some of this land is private. However, there are still proper procedures regarding the work to be carried out. We are not fully sure these procedures were followed. This is a question we will follow up on with the City of Winnipeg.In addition to any environmental concerns, there is also a question about the archeological significance of this property as it does pass near or through the former Métis road allowance village known as Rooster Town. We do have our own concerns about how the residents of Rooster Town were treated and would not want a repeat of those events where Métis interests and concerns were not fully respected or considered. We would expect that an impact analysis of the development of this area to be conducted.Thank youJonathan HamelCommunications Coordinator”","August 4, 2017","$15,790","$25,000 "
Peter Macneil ,"Halifax, NS","Babies, Kids & Family","Recently Helen MacNeil’s accessible van for her daughter Felicia broke down for good. This was the only transportation for her and Felicia and she does not have the funds to replace it. This vehicle was needed to get her to Halifax from Newglasgow for appointments for Felicia.  You see, Felicia is handicap from a terrible accident when Helen was giving birth, an oxygen tank was dropped on Helens stomach causing Felicia to be permanently brain damaged, she can not walk, talk or eat on her own. Since that day Helen has devoted her life to taking care of this sweet girl and has continued to beat the odds. Her love for her daughter is the strongest I have ever seen. Helen even designed and built by hand a custom bed for Felicia making it fully accessible. Helen has done so much for Felicia everyday but is also an inspiration to the community. she convinced the local school to install an elevator so kids with special needs can go to gym class. She donated hours of time to school events and even dressed up like dr Seuss and made all the kids green eggs and ham. Helen and Felicia are famous for their local Canada day party held every year and their giant tiger ladies day out that unfortunately they can no longer do. This woman is an absolute inspiration and deserves a medal for worlds greatest mother even though she wouldn’t take it because to her she’s just doing what she is ment to, love her child no matter what. She asks for nothing and deserves the world. Please help me in my pursuit to ensure these woman have the opportunity to to continue their daily routine.

Louisa Meléndez ,"Hackettstown, NJ","Medical, Illness & Healing","My name is Reinaldo Colón, born in Puerto Rico in 1964. I grew up like any other kid. In 1989 I graduated from college; something I thought that I would never complete. In 1986 while studying late at night; when I went to get into my car, while opening the door, I fell down like a mango from a tree. With help I recuperated, rested a few minutes, and finally got into my house. I began seeing all types of doctors and had all types of tests done. Nobody could find what caused me to fall down. I was getting worse every day, I began seeing double, not able to articulate a word, numbness in the entire right side of the body beginning in the head and ending in the toe. While all of this happens, I was told about a good neurologist in the capital with whom I made an appointment. Because I was getting worse every day, my parents called this neurologist and he asked me to go to the hospital where he works. The first thing I saw when I got into the hospital room was a table with a tray with three long needles to be used by the neurologist to perform a lumbar puncture. I was asked to move into a fetal position so that my spinal cord would be more exposed. The first needle he used was to numb the area, the second needle was to make sure the liquid was where he was looking for it, and the third needle was to extract the spinal cord liquid. This sample was sent to the United States and tested for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). While I was hospitalized, the results from the US came back with a positive diagnostic of MS. Back then there were no specialized medications for MS, so the doctor put me in a treatment of steroids. The neurologist told me that MS happens more frequently in women than in men, and I remember telling him that I was a man who has gotten MS. He instructed me to eat a lot of tomatoes and green leafs. With the steroids treatment, I got better and my stay at the hospital lasted nine days.  I asked the doctor if the MS would hampered my studies of engineering. He told me that the MS affected my muscles not my brain. He also told me not to over exercise because of all the steroids I was given. At 22 years old I was diagnosed with MS; this is when my journey with MS began. Since then my health has been a roller coaster, but I was determined to make the fight against MS. I continued my studies and finally graduated from college achieving my dream of becoming an electronics engineer. After college I had some stability called in medical terms; remissions. I was able to still play basketball, softball and some golf. I got my first job, the same one I still work at. I have been on numerous different medications not for a cure, but to prevent new exacerbations and to manage the symptoms. To mentioned some of them: Copaxone, Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, Mehtrotaxate, Prednisone, Intravenous Chemotherapy, Tysabri, Gilenya, Tecfidera, Ampyra, Cladribine and few more that I cannot recall anymore. Some of them have been effective temporarily, others have not. I had a couple of years with not many episodes; however, the MS has been progressively gaining my body and limiting my daily activities. I started using a cane to help my balance while walking, but now I use a wheelchair all the time when not at home. To help me keep walking, I use a walker at home and hold onto things to move very short distances. I cannot walk five steps without falling down because I have no balance. I changed my lifestyle for a healthier one with natural supplements and special attention to food. I have lost 37 pounds and it has helped my family help me when I fall. I go to physical therapy once per week. My work provides me with a good health plan, and thanks to that I have been able keep fighting against MS. However, there are so many maintenance medications, therapy and doctor appointments that co-pays really take a toll on my family. My wife and three children are very supportive. My little one, now 12, used to take rides with me in the wheelchair until not long ago. My wife always says that we have an ARMY of FRIENDS and that is very true, without our extended family and network of friends our lives would be much harder. We are always looking and searching for any new development for MS. I owe that to my little one. She is my new reason to fight MS. Recently we found information about a novel combination of two treatments for MS patients; Transvascular Autonomic Modulation (TVAM) and Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) therapy, which offers high hopes to alleviate symptoms in MS patients. TVAM is performed in different countries and several patients from Canada come to US to get this treatment. The combination with the MSC is a novel approach currently performed in USA. We have contacted the doctor’s office in California where the treatment has been performed since 2008, and verified the cost and calculated all out of the pocket expenses after the health insurance coverage. This is considered an investigational treatment; therefore not many health insurances cover the treatment. In my case, my health insurance will cover a fairly good part, but the treatment is expensive and in addition to out of the pocket expenses and travel expenses to get the treatment, it is really almost impossible to make it a real possibility. I would like to be able to enjoy a better quality of life and be able to be there for my daughter. I have seen the testimony of many patients that have had the treatment and I know there is hope for me and for many other MS patients. I cannot stay doing nothing. I would appreciate any help to make the novel approach of TVAM and MSC treatment possible. I will keep you informed of every step taken on the way. There is no help too little, even if you cannot help monetarily, please help to share my cause with others by posting it on your social media and use the hashtag #helpreifightMS. Not only will you be aiding me to get this TVAM / MSC treatment but you are helping to spread awareness of MS. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story and Thank You in advance for your consideration. Please feel free to contact me at GoFundMe should you need additional information or if you have any questions.

Keith Chadwick ,"Nepean, ON",Business & Entrepreneurs,"HistoryI have always had plants in my life. Whether as a child in my grandmother’s garden or later turning my living room in a jungle. In fact, I still have the very first house plant my grandmother gave me when I was 8, it’s now over 40 years old.In 2015 my father passed away and I left my 25 year career as a software engineer. Over the years I had become more and more unhappy writing code. It got to the point where it was damaging my mental health. Several years earlier, in 2010, I had become a full-time single dad to my two young lads who at the time were 4 and 5. At that time I started a vegetable garden with peppers and tomatoes and in 2011 I ventured into hydroponics with peppers. I found it was an excellent stress reliever and a hobby I could do at home while keeping an eye on my two young lads.In 2016, I built my 24x56 foot greenhouse at Maple Hill Farm and starting growing in earnest. In 2017 I started to offer seedlings to order and sell produce at the farm in a self-serve manner. In 2018 I did the same again with even greater success. However, after two years it became clear I had two major problems. One, I did not have enough food to sell and two, the self-serve room located in the barn only catered to a very small number of customers.While I had managed to cover my costs in both of these years with my sales, it was clear that if I am going to make a living of this I had to solve these two issues. After many hours of research, design and thought I have divided this expansion into two distinct projects.ProjectsThe first project is the expansion of the growing area from my 1300 square foot hydroponic greenhouse to 4000 square feet of hydroponics. This expansion comes with an expansion of food diversity as well. Beyond my normal range of hot and sweet peppers along with lettuce and tomatoes, I will be adding the following,1.       Several types of cucumber2.       Beans & Peas3.       Several types of eggplant4.       More herbs included Fennel5.       More leafy greens like Bok Choi and broccoli  The expansion will more than double my food production and add in 512 square feet of hydroponic tank. This will include 128 square feet of float beds for leafy greens like lettuce. Like most projects I do the vast majority of the work. For the past several weeks I have been busy cutting and painting the more than 1000 pieces of wood that will make up the new tanks and tank covers. The material costs are roughly $1500 of which I already purchased.The largest issue is the preparation of the 3000 square foot gravel pad for the expansion. This I cannot do as it involves over 20 tonnes of gravel and to be level to within a ½ inch tolerance. This requires the hiring of a contractor and will cost roughly around 3K-4K. This project must be completed by the end of May.The second project is a 12x24 storefront located on the farm road next to Moodie drive. I plan to have this ready sometime in July, the earlier the better. The design is already complete but there are some details in regards to finishing and material purchases that I can’t fully sort out as yet. Like most things, I will be completing all the labour along with some volunteers. I plan to open the store on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays initially. There will be more than just fresh products in the store but they will all be local. There are some surprises in store, pun intended that I do not wish to give away. The cost of this project is all materials and is roughly $2500.DonatingSo now to the important part, what does your donation do? Well besides the obvious, I am offering something a little different. You have three options.Option 1: I just wish to donate to this projectOption 2: I would like to make my donation as a future purchase.With this option, you can get 100% of your donation back through purchases at the store. Each time you make a purchase you will receive 50% off your purchase. This will go against the money you donated.Option 3: I would like to make my donation a Pay it Forward for FAMSACWith this option, your donation will be given as fresh produce to FAMSAC over the season. I have arranged to provide FAMSAC with fresh produce every week. This option is like giving twice!Given that GoFundMe does not provide a mechanism to do options 1 and 2 it will be managed by me outside of GoFundMe. This is how it works.1.       Make your GoFundMe donation and leave your name or even a simple keyword2.       Contact me via email or Facebook (on FB you can contact me through the Hottawa Peppers page).3.       Tell me you wish to participate in either Option 2 or 3.      a.       If Option 2 I will provide you an account number and password to use when you make purchases.      b.       If Option 3 you will be notified via FB when some or all of your donation heads to FAMSAC. This notification will be in public. If you wish for it to remain private please let me know.If you wish to share your account with someone feel free to do so. Perhaps you know someone who is in need and could do with inexpensive healthy food. This is yet another way your donation can go even further! As your account is used I will update you periodically with the balance of the account via email or FB.Mission StatementI consider myself very fortunate to be located at Maple Hill Farm. I can only describe it as a true community. There are dozens and dozens of gardeners, each with there own plot. We have gardeners who grow for themselves and others who grow for others. I have seen groups sitting on lawn chairs next to their shared plot sharing laughs, food and drink. It truly is a community and one that deeply reflects the diversity within Canada.On weekends there are often families visiting to take the Alpacas for a walk, meet piggy the pig, get chased by Bonnie and Clyde the ducks or wave to Lilly and her son Sylvester the cows. There are chickens running around and the screeches of the Guinee fowl and of course all the goats. Many times the goats are participating in the Yoga classes in the barn or the field.In the fall there is, of course, the corn maze and pumpkins everywhere. We even have classes of school kids coming to learn about farming, animals and of course hot peppers. I have given countless tours to both school classes and families of the greenhouse.  Each tour I get to explain the importance of food sovereignty and the multiple benefits of local food and of course, hydroponics.My mission statement is not about the selling of produce and making a living at it. My mission statement is about creating and educating a community on the importance of local food. The storefront I am planning on building won’t just have food in it. It will have information. For example, I will be creating a map of all the local food vendors in the area. If you come to me and ask, do you have any celery? I will tell you that no I don’t but head down to Veggie Trails and see Steve and Tammy they have some for sale. They are on the corner of Holly Acres and Robertson.Hottawa Peppers is about YOU, not me. It is about providing you fresh local food via ALL of our great local vendors. It is about building a community that I want you to be a part of. My mission statement is…To create, educate and support a healthy community, based around the benefits of hyper local food.Thank you for taking the time to read. If you are unable to donate that’s ok, but please come by and visit this summer. ThankyouKeith Chadwick","March 13, 2019","$1,065","$7,000 "
Richard Dalimonte ,"Raised $600 from 8 donationsWest Bloomfield, MI",Community & Neighbors,"Todd shared the following story of what has happened over the past year.Todd and I met in 10th grade at Sault Ste Marie, MI High School. Had lockers next to each other and were both Italians. He and I have shared some wonderful times together over the years.He went into the Marines in 1987 after he graduated from Sault High. After the Marines, he went into the Commercial Contracting business with his Father in Toronto, Canada. Todd has always been in great shape and stopped smoking 5 years ago after visiting a hypnotist in Toronto. Stopped smoking same day!Todd and I spoke just after the Super Bowl that Todd shares below.On January 31st, 2019 before my big Super Bowl party the unthinkable happened. In my condominium in Toronto, I collapsed and was brought to the emergency hospital to find out why. My kidneys shut down, I had two rounds of dialysis. I Stayed at the hospital for two weeks. Within  those two weeks, they found I had testicular stage III seminoma cancer. At the time, they reassured me that it was a very treatable disease. The treatment protocol was 20 rounds of chemotherapy, no surgery and no radiation needed. Even though I was told that possible blood clots may happen when you go through chemotherapy. They were giving me blood thinners injections prior to getting my chemo therapy injections. They told me I need not to worry about the blood clots.>> My first week of treatment went well and I went straight to work everyday after treatment. My second week of chemo my girlfriend decided to call the oncologist to see what  side effects to watch out for. One of them was a blood clot and stroke. On my 10th round of chemo my arm was somewhat paralyzed and my girlfriend told me to call the ambulance. When the ambulance got there I walked down to the ambulance and they asked me why I walked down to the Ambulance instead of waiting for them to come up to my apartment. As they said that to me it was then that the Stroke happened. . So unfortunately as much as we try to plan, I never planned to have a stroke. The chemo caused the blood clot which then caused the stroke. It also caused a blood clot to my  right foot which then had to be amputated 6 inches from below the knee, as well as I developed gang green. Now I’m left paralyzed on my left side and on my right side is where the amputation is. No matter how we try to plan our life and how much insurance we have we never planned to have this happen.In order to be independent again, unfortunately I have incurred some expenses that I’m not prepared for.Todd has been in the hospital for over a year now since being diagnosed. Any contribution is greatly appreciated.God Bless you all and Todd Demerino, Brother, Friend and Marine!Love you brother!","November 21, 2019","$1,900","$5,000 "

The primary and secondary school is built from sticks and card boxes leaking laminates roof, with only parents volunteering as teachers.  The Antorchista community is located only 20 km from Tulum a fast-growing posh tourist destination of hotels and resorts and too far to walk from the nearest public schools in Macario Gomez the next Mayan town on the road from Tulum to Coba.   A limp folded colorful fabric sign is hanging on the dirt road welcoming the residents of  Colonia Antrochista on an unpaved road of hasty self-build houses and structures.This pilot initiative seeks to transmute the deficiency into an advantage by inspiring human resourcefulness and determination to turn themselves around paving the road for a brighter future for their children, the community, the environment and in the hope that this pilot project will act as a light torch and inspire many other communities to follow their example.     Imagine a school built almost entirely from plastic bottles collected on the side of the road, in the dunes near the ocean, and in the many dumpsites.  The material costs nothing and the collecting of the bottles prevents its burning and actually cleans the environment.  Now Imagine a Community gathering where everyone young and old, men women and children come together for a shared purpose filling these bottles with sand.This is just a beginning, next step it to use advanced and inexpensive ingenious solutions of water filtration, sewage management, solar and wind energy and internet accessibility to further create a truly sustainable, green-based technological environment to empower economically disadvantaged communities to support themselves and take charge of their future and their children's future.  We are not only involved in the school building but offering classes to the community with volunteers from all over the world who donate their time and enthusiasm by sharing their gifts with the children.  Art classes had been a hit as well as English classes end even children Yoga, Hygiene, and music.  We invite you to get in touch with us if you wish to volunteer and donate your time and gifts with this community by emailing to heartpulsepartnership@gmail.com or text to +19173229331The young students using blocks as tables while waiting for their bottle school to be builtJoint effort of the children and the community is coming to fruition With the enthusiasm and support of Sai Jerrybandan the president of a wonderful NGO United hearts, we expanded the scope of the campaign.  United hearts joined heart with the heart Pulse Partnership to secure and repair also the primary school which is just a few yards down the road. The primary school serves very young children 4-8 years old.  The mothers were complaining that the cardboard laminate roof was leaking.  Upon further inspections we discovered that the structure that holds the roof is falling apart and the whole structure is not sound and can collapse on the children in strong winds.  Thanks to Sai's amazing support and other donors we are taking on the primary school as well to replace the roof and secure its structure.I want to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to Sai Jerrybandan, Gisela Stromeyer who is in Tulum at the moment overlooking the bottle school build up, Dror Ashuah, Caty Petersen, Saul Smaili, and Kenneth Berst for your unwavering support.  If you wish to join us and volunteer your time, please let us know.   ￼Primary school now being repaired and reinforced￼Primary school cardboard laminates roof b=now being replaced￼Primary school inside cardboard and sticks ￼Primary school detail￼Sai gifting the children￼The first layer of  bottles were laid down today to build the School outer wall￼￼Gisela Stromeyer ￼Dror Ashuah￼Dror Ashuah with Kenneth Berst￼Saul Smaili Teaching English and art in the Makeshift school￼Gathering after class with (left to right) Sai, Bubzi, Dror, and Alexa after each child have received a backpack and clothing gift following their art and English Class￼Gisela and community mothers filling up bottles while their children are in class.￼Alexa from Canada teaching Art to the children ￼Carlos is drawing Hearts a symbol for this initiativeA recycled bottles structure on my land used as the model for the school Myself Dror Ashuah with Kenneth Berst ￼In October 2017, I was fortunate to lead a United Nations-sponsored Peace mission to Mexico alongside Gisela Stromeyer.

Bonnie Foley-Wong ,"Vancouver, BC",Education & Learning,"“You can’t be what you can’t see.” Marian Wright EdelmanGrowing up in a working-class family, I did not see investors nor entrepreneurs. My mom was a bank teller. My dad was a postal worker. What I did see was my parents take great personal risk to invest in the future of their children. Maybe that’s why I work so hard or more women and underrepresented and underestimated people to be investors and entrepreneurs and for more people to be able to access the resources they need to survive, thrive, and be happy. When my mom was my age, she did a courageous thing. After 17 years of being a stay-at-home mom, she got new training and returned to the workforce. And now I’m following in her footsteps and getting new training! However, the goal is far bigger and I hope to help more people as a result.Stepping Into the Belly of the BeastI have been accepted to VCUnlocked  at Stanford University, an intensive investor training program. It is a highly sought after program, meant to educate and accelerate early-stage investors and venture capital managers. Having successfully passed a competitive application process, I have the rare opportunity to access and connect with leaders from a global network affiliated with Stanford University and 500 Startups. Incredible leaders like Arlan Hamilton of Backstage Capital and Pocket Sun and Elizabeth Galbut of SoGal Ventures graduated from this program and went on to help hundreds of women and underrepresented entrepreneurs. Through this program I hope to:- Find aligned partners and potential investors for Pique’s second fund focused on tech for good and leadership diversity,- Get help and mentorship,- Gain insights into how I could manage and lead Pique better.Fighting for equity, inclusion, and taking care of people and the planet feels so hard sometimes - like I’m pushing a boulder up a mountain. I founded Pique Ventures  to move money in a more purposeful way and to enable a more diverse community of investors. We’ve been around for 7 years and now it’s time to level-up. Please help me do that.""Talent is equally distributed, opportunity is not."" Leila JanahYou may have seen some of the stats about women in the VC industry:- Only 2.2% of venture capital went to women-led companies.- Less than 15% of venture capital partners - the people making the investment decisions - are women.- Women hold only 9% of startup equity.And if we look at the numbers for minorities and people of color, they are even smaller.Although personal savings and bank debt are the main sources of startup capital, venture capital is still an important source of capital for startups. Venture capital-backed businesses affect us significantly because they are supplying your banks, your grocery stores, your news outlets, your social media platforms, your healthcare providers, your schools, and your employers, just to name a few.Women and minorities are underrepresented, underestimated, and almost shut out of the VC industry. Their perspectives are not adequately taken into account when products are made or services are delivered. It means products and services are not designed with us in mind - and that leads to dissatisfaction, inconvenience, or worse yet safety risks.It Takes a VillageI spoke with McKeever (Mac) Connell, II, co-manager of the Build Fund at the Maryland Technology Economic Development Corporation, who will be attending VC Unlocked as well.He said something that really resonated with me. An entrepreneur had said to him, ""The community I come from it’s a sign of weakness to ask for help and money.” I feel this too - people seek my advice and help all the time and I love helping people. When it comes to asking for help, I recoil in shame. However, I realized that this had to change. In order for me to help more people, I can’t do this alone.Help me access the training, resources, and connections needed to scale these impacts and outcomes. I’m hoping I’ll gain new insights that will help us grow Pique to be able to help even more women and underrepresented entrepreneurs.About Me (Bonnie Foley-Wong)I'm the founder of Pique Ventures , an impact investment firm investing in a diverse community of leaders building early-stage companies that care, connect, and protect. I have over 20 years of experience of advising and financing entrepreneurs in Europe and North America. I wrote and published Integrated Investing: Impact Investing with Head, Heart, Body, and Soul and I have been published in Business Insider, Time, Inc., Forbes, Huffington Post, Apple News, Green Money Journal, and National Observer. I'm passionate about developing the next generation of entrepreneurs and finance professionals and often give my time as a mentor to emerging leaders and startup founders. I serve on the Board of the Women’s Enterprise Centre of BC. In 2018, my efforts to create a more diverse community of investors and entrepreneurs was recognized by the YWCA Women of Distinction Awards, in the category of Entrepreneurship & Innovation. This year, I'm a nominee for a Startup Canada Entrepreneur Promotion Award, and a nominee in the RBC Canadian Women Entrepreneur Awards. I'm also qualified as an alpine ski instructor and puts my decision-making and negotiation skills to use with my two children!About Pique Ventures and Our ImpactI built Pique Ventures to change the ratio and with our first fund, we invested in 7 women-founded tech ventures in Vancouver with the backing of 41 investors - 32 of which are women, representing 75% of the capital. Around a third of our investors identify as people of colour. Looking at all the members of the management teams of our portfolio companies, 42% are women (more than 3 times better than the industry average of 13%). 26% are people of colour (I don’t know what the industry average is because it’s really challenging getting business owners and leaders to even gather this data!)Pique has inspired others to invest in and with impact. We’ve helped and championed entrepreneurs through big changes, tough decisions, and success on their terms. It’s through Pique’s business model that I’m able to provide help and advice to people who don’t have the resources nor experience yet.Who We HelpSince we launched our first fund in 2014, Pique Ventures invested in seven women-founded ventures including:- Jessica Regan - who is using technology to divert food waste from landfill and reducing CO2 emissions at FoodMesh .- Jennifer Li Chiang - who is disrupting influencer marketing at MuseFind .- Christine Sommers - who is innovating how we connect and find each other during emergencies at ePACT Network .- Catherine Dahl - who is disrupting accounting software at Beanworks .- Dr. Alexandra Greenhill - who is leveraging technology to make care patient-centred and collaborative at Careteam .And we want to help many more entrepreneurs!We’re investing in companies that reduce inequalities and level the playing field.We want to invest in more companies that help make our planet and natural resources last longer and for future generations.About VC UnlockedVC Unlocked  at Stanford University is a 2-week residential educational program, led by 4 faculty members from Stanford University (Michael Lepech, Mike Lyons, Trevor Loy, and Pedram Mokrian), alongside Christine Tsai and Bedy Yang from 500 Startups.

Michelle Histand ,"Philadelphia, PA",Other,"The Travesty That Happened TodayToday in Philadelphia, not far from where the constitution was signed and the Liberty Bell sits, two families of Syrian descent were denied entry into the country because of the president's ban on Syrian refugees and immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries.Despite getting the necessary visas and clearance for green cards, after 18 hours of travel they were told they had to get back on a plane and go back. Go back to what?  Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney explains this could be a death sentence for the families: ""I am sickened by reports that federal officials, without knowledge or cooperation of PHL Airport staff, detained and then turned away two Syrian families. By several accounts, these families waited months to obtain the proper documentation so they could come to our country legally.""And still, they were sent back to a war-torn nation that has used chemical warfare against its own people. The Trump administration very well may have just given these families a death sentence.""Republican Congressman Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania agreed, telling The Washington Post on Saturday, “This is ridiculous. I guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world.”This is not about political parties or allegiances - it's about humanity, plain and simple. It's about helping fellow people who did everything right and just want to escape the massive slaughter that forced them from their home. The PlanThis gofundme is to raise funds for these families, as we attempt to bring them back to the United States where they will meet with their family here, who have been anxiously awaiting their arrival since the visa process was started in 2003. I have reached out to their family connections in Allentown so we can get these funds directly to two families who are currently in the air and in limbo. I have connections liasing with the mayor and other official offices to assess where the families can be directed once they land in Dubai. Given that the ban has received a temporary stay in federal court, we're hopeful we can get them back here quickly. Funds will cover airfare for 8 (approximately $10,000) and help provide essentials when the families -hopefully- finally arrive here.Back-Up PlanShould the families be denied entry to the country on a more permanent basis, funds will go directly to them to help them set up a base whereever they land. We are also looking into getting them safely to Canada, as the Prime Minister has said Canada continues to welcome refugees in the face of this insanity.","January 28, 2017","$1,570","$25,000 "
Abby Johnson ,"Shawano, WI",Other,"Hello to all our friends and family.  As many of you know, Jasper is pursuing his dream of professional racing by entering the Pirelli World Challange.  This series runs throughout the summer and is composed of six broadcasted weekend races. The first race in March was at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, TX; followed by Motorsport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada and most recently at Lime Rock, CT.  Jasper has been vastly improving throughout these races - each time moving up the leader board.  This week he was less than a second off the leader and his fastest lap time put him in the top four. With only three more races left and the possibility of this class being cancelled next year due to lack of support, his goal of a podium finish and bringing home some ""hardware"" makes these last few races so important to us, especially to him. So as I am sure you all are wondering what this page is for...This whole adventure started with Jasper getting an offer from a team to drive their car at Road America in Elkhart Lake; however that offer was revoked as they found someone to race the entire series.  After being letdown at the chance  to race at the professional level, he came across a ""race ready"" Honda Fit that was for sale.  Without doing much investigating and being rather impulsive, Jasper and I were on the road to Vancouver in January to pick up our own car for the series.  As we have been finding out, there have been hidden fees at every step along the way, and the car wasn't as race ready as claimed.  So throughout the entire series, he has been making cut backs.Jasper is the ONLY driver in his class that solely owns his car and has ZERO sponsors.  Other drivers in his class have several sponsorship packages starting at $10,000 and factory engineers only a phone call away and some even at the track offering their full support.   Some are even given brand new cars straight from the factory.  We unfortunately weren't that lucky, and not to discredit myself, but I am really all he has for ""technical"" support and help on the road.  Every team uses a new set of tires for EVERY race at a minimum of $450....we have yet to go through a set. He just now changed his used brakes while the other teams get a new set every weekend.  All other drivers spend around $1,000 to practice for an hour on the track prior to the race, while the first time Jasper gets to see the track is during his 12 minutes of qualifying time.  In most cases, he is still learning the track during the first half of his race. As you can see, the cost of this experience is more than we ever anticipated.  I want to do everything possible to help Jasper reach this once in a lifetime dream.  I would use all of the donations to go towards practice time at the next three tracks, so he is given the opportunity to learn the track and find his groove prior to the green flag, for new tires, and to help him with additional costs along the way.All of you know Jasper and how he goes over and above to help so many of you.  Now, I am asking just a little help for him.  He has zero part in this, but I see how close he is at every race and I know how desperately he wants a podium finish.  He is soooo close. I honestly believe he can accomplish this and I know with just a little help from our friends, we can make his dream come true.Thank you,Abby","May 28, 2016","$1,870","$2,500 "

Colin Benedict ,"Raised $410 from 5 donationsIthaca, NY",Education & Learning,"Native American and Indigenous Students At Cornell (NAISAC) is fundraising to cover expenses for the upcoming Ivy Native Conference. The Ivy Native Conference is an event that takes place each semester at a different Ivy League and is the largest gathering of Native American undergraduate students in the country. Cornell is hosting the Ivy Native Conference on March 22nd-24th 2019. The purpose of the Ivy Native Conference Spring 2019 is to explore the evolution of Native American and Indigenous fashion from traditional to the 21st century, how it is used as an expression of Native American Culture, and how this form of art has given a voice to Native American peoples and bring attention to issues affecting us today. Speakers will be presenting on various topics surrounding Indigenous voices in fashion on March 23rd, with the day culminating in the keynote dinner that will take place in the Willard Straight Hall Memorial Room from 6-8:30pm. Your donations will help to pay for food expenses for the conference, and allow the 150 Native undergrads to eat in the three days that they spend at Cornell. Speakers for the conference include: Sage Paul Named as one of the Top 25 Women of Influence 2018, Sage Paul is an urban Denesuline woman and a member of English River First Nation.

Max Kingsley ,"Moncton, NB",Education & Learning,"There is a family of refugees I am close with. Both parents are very hardworking, young people. Unlike some people's stereotypes on HNIC, the mother is studying hard to be fluent in English and the father works long hours driving a taxi to earn enough to house and feed the family. They are both kind, generous people who love Canada, pay taxes, and are striving to gain their Canadian citizenship. They have 5 young kids ranging from 2 and a half years old to 13 years. Last year I asked my followers to send me any used electronics they had kicking around, thinking these kids would be able to put them to good use accessing the internet, which will strengthen their English + French skills, and help them do homework, etc. Right away a few people mentioned having some things they'd happily send and in just a few weeks enough devices were going to be sent for the oldest 4 kids. It was right before Christmas and I was working long 12-hour shifts, and fighting a flu that felt more like pneumonia, but when I had the strength I kept trying to organize this. I waited until I knew the oldest 4 kids would each have a device of their own and then I told the children what kind and generous people across Canada were doing for them. They were so happy and excited. They couldn't wait to get their new-to-them but gently used devices.But nothing arrived. The people who had assured me they would send devices for these refugee kids never did send them. I asked again and was told they'd mail it as soon as they could. But still, nothing ever came. I had to go back to the children and explain they would get nothing. The kids were disappointed but they're good kids so I thought they'd get over it. However, a few months after Christmas when my work contract had ended I was visiting with their family one day, and the 11-year old son asked me, ""Why did Santa go to everybody else's house and bring their kids presents but not us?""That broke my heart a little. But they're Muslim! So Christmas is not a traditional holiday to expect a Muslim family to celebrate, right? But then when you see it from a kid's point of view, it does look like Santa neglected them......And then there's the fact that they do participate in all the other traditionally celebrated events in Canadian culture, such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, Halloween, Easter egg hunts...Ya, I kicked myself. Of course they'd feel excluded on Christmas as the rest of the world woke up to presents and turkey with stuffing and gravy...while they woke up empty-handed.You see, I'd been busy community organising to keep Moncton's homeless fed and sheltered last winter and after the promised electronic devices fell through, and no one sent anything, I hadn't anything else for these angelic little kids. I didn't make them any kind of gift, or even bake them something sweet to enjoy over their 2 week holiday from school.So all year knowing about this failure has sucked because I know these kids left a war zone just a few years ago where they cried as they hid with their parents under their stairs in their house every time they heard bombs falling only 15km from their home, only to come here (and this family has most certainly gone over and above what's required of them to integrate into our society), only to be neglected on that one special day of the year where everyone should be made to feel welcome, accepted, cherished and included in Canada.If there was an emoji for ""kicks own ass"" I would insert it here.You may know by now, I am not the richest person in the world. But I have told the kids we'll write letters to Santa this month. And when all the Halloween candy went on sale after Halloween, I spent $50 I earned from a brief contract I had last month and bought enough lollipops and bite-size chocolates to fill a stocking for each of the 5 children. I have yet to purchase the 5 stockings but if I have to I'll sew them by hand myself from red clothing I own. Although I'd like to have their names embroidered on their stocking, that costs more than I can afford right now so I will settle for writing it on in magic marker or with a glitter glue pen if I can find a cheap red or green one.If there is any generosity in you to donate so these kids don't wake up on Christmas wondering why Santa never visits them, I will use all donations to buy used electronics such as the 4 used iPad minis in the picture. If there isn't enough donations to buy those particular devices, I'll buy other less-expensive, used electronics, so the oldest 4 kids each get one. It may interest you to know the 2 and a half year old does know how to use a touch-pad, but she'll also be just as satisfied with only a stocking full of lollipops. If I weren't poor, I'd get her something too, but it feels like asking a lot to ask the public to donate $450 to buy 4 of the 5 kids a Christmas present so they don't have to feel bad again this year.Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you and all the special kids in your life never have to wake up feeling forgotten by the whole world on Christmas day. I was a foster child so I'm used to it. When you have no family there is no Christmas. But even at the age of 42 it stinks to be left out of the Christmas celebrations going on all around me throughout the season, so I truly am aware that refugee kids should enjoy Christmas just like the rest of the world around them (with their parents' consent, of course, with whom I have cleared this). A third party will purchase the electronics for these children. Any extra money above the goal of this campaign will be spent on their family having a traditional turkey dinner, which I volunteer to cook with the kids so their parents can finally have a day to relax. Please give if you can afford to. Thanks kindly,Max","November 11, 2019",300 $,500 $ 
Meaghan Onorato ,"Bolton, ON",Volunteer & Service,"Hi Everyone!For those of you that may not know me personally, my name is Meaghan Onorato. I’m a traveler and ocean lover, originally from Caledon, Ontario. After spending a few years living in Western Australia, I am planning to return to help the wild Indian Ocean that I fell in love with throughout my travels. Through Global Vision International, my goal is to get myself to Baie Ternay Marine National Park, Seychelles, East Africa for 8 weeks collecting data on coral reef health and recovery following climate-change-induced coral bleaching events. Since returning to Toronto, I have noticed that ocean conservation is not a priority for many people. I believe it falls under the category of ‘out of sight, out of mind’, so I feel extremely privileged to have the knowledge and appreciation of how important coral is for our beloved planet, no matter where our daily lives may take place. My goal is to do my part to contribute to coral reef recovery research and coral rehabilitation, so that generations to come can fall in love with the magic of our beautiful oceans as I have. If you aren’t aware of the situation, I encourage you to watch Chasing Coral on Netflix, as an easy way to gain insight on some of the major issues at hand. Sadly, volunteering is not cheap! This GoFundMe is to fund raise enough to cover the program fees ($6640+tax) that include all necessary project equipment, materials and training, meals, park fees and permits etc. I will personally be paying for all other large costs that go along with my journey, such as flights($3000+), certifications(395+), vaccinations and so on. Your contribution means everything to me! Your contribution helps support people taking action to create positive change, data collection to assist The Seychelles Centre for Marine Research & Technology in the health and preservation of the coral reefs, The Seychelles Fishing Authority with monitoring commonly harvested species like octopus and lobster(that makes it all the way to your dinner plate in North America!). Our entire planet is connected so please support me in my efforts to keep Earth Green and BLUE Please visit the GVI Canada website to view more information on my specific program at:https://www.gvicanada.ca/programs/climate-change-and-coral-bleaching-in-seychelles/ For our beaches and oceans,Meaghan Onorato ","April 3, 2019",$130,"$7,500 "
Bisi Jagun ,"Potomac, MD",Education & Learning," Fellow IFEMED Alumni,  My name is Dr Olabisi Jagun - I am a member of the 1979 graduating class of IFEMED! I was one of only 4 female graduates of that class!!!!In the late 60’s and early 70’s, a group of medical education rebels led by Professor Ige Grillo left the University of Ibadan for Ife to start a revolution in medical education!!! They designed a curriculum to educate physicians for the challenges of the next millennium; they were several years ahead of their time; way ahead of everybody else! They foresaw a physician trained and equipped to practice medicine with an integrated team to solve medical problems in communities both urban and rural! I am a fortunate recipient of this medical education revolution! I graduated in the second set! I arrived Ife as a teenager and left Ife as a WOMAN ready to take on the world!!! I am extremely passionate about all things IFE!!!! In the past 2 decades, IFEMED has fallen on hard times; our institution is facing tremendous challenges and mounting obstacles are standing in the way of effective delivery of quality medical education. Like all the other Govt-owned and government-run teaching hospitals in Nigeria, IFEMED has had to compete for dwindling resources from the Federal Govt!!! Subsequently, her infrastructures are crumbling; technology and equipment are outdated; her library is bare and her laboratories are a joke! A couple of Schools within the College have critical re-Accreditations looming!! As we speak, the school of Dentistry has lost its accreditation - how unfortunate!Quite honestly, our college needs a massive infusion of cash for renovations of her run-down facilities and updating of her infrastructures; labs need to be equipped and brought to current standards; our Clinical Skills, Simulation and Robotics Lab needs to be completed and fully running.Most of these listed ""projects"" need to be tackled immediately; only few of the renovations can wait!! It is our sacred obligation as an alumni body to equip the College with the tools she needs to deliver first class medical education. No scholl within our College should lose accreditation.  I am currently starting a directory of IFEMED alumni members - I plan to reach at least 250 alumni to raise $250,000 for our beloved alma mata! I also plan to host 250 IFEMED alums, friends and family for a reunion Gala in Washington DC on Friday,June 28th, 2019 to celebrate our medical school. This date was chosen to coincide with ANPA Alumni night - ANPA convenes her annual convention in Washington DC that weekend. I look forward to seeing you all when you come to DC; for those alums unable to join us in DC, please mail your checks to the IFEMED fund anyway. I pray almighty God always bless and favor you for your anticipated generous donation to this Fund.Please help me - forward this email to all alumni in Nigeria, Australia, Europe, Canada, USA and the Americas, Middle East and worldwide!  I will always remember with special nostalgia my 7 yr stay at Moremi Hall; I always marveled at the sheer beauty of our campus ( the most beautiful in sub-Saharan Africa)! We took for granted our imposing buildings (some of them, like Oduduwa Hall are still considered architectural landmarks)! Our lawns were perfectly manicured; our parks and gardens were pristine! The approach to our university driving on Road 1 was and still is breathtakingly spectacular.Shout out to you if you resided in Angola Hall, Mozambique, Fajuyi, Postgraduate Hall; a special shout-out to you if you lived off-campus!!!!These were happy days; Ife students were confident and proud; in the words of Jayzee, Our Swag was Different!!! Our campus was the happening destination every weekend - students from Ibadan, Benin,Lagos,Enugu etc could not wait for the weekend to arrrive - they descended on our campus in droves for friendship, fun, parties, rallies, sporting events, art and theater.Graduates of IFEMED are all over the globe making tremendous impact in their chosen fields of endeavors; we are community leaders, State Governors, Monarchs of prominent kingdoms, Commissioners, CEOs, passionate advocates for peace, justice & equality; dutiful custodians of our planet ( shout out to my classmate and friend- Dr GP “green potential”)! To fellow alums who have gone back and given back since you graduated, I respect you; I salute you!  Over the past 15 years, IFEMED alumni have come together to raise funds to help our college; a large group of us raised over $70,000 to purchase a coaster bus to ferry students for clinicals; an even larger group raised over $150,000 to build and equip an impressive Clinical Skills/Simulation/Robotics Lab to enhance student learning capacity; Individuals and other smaller groups have funded different projects and renovations within the college; dialysis machines have been donated! Our alums have volunteered time, sweat and money to help our college! More recently, some of us have visited our college to teach, heal and give!!!! In April 2017 and again this year, more than 10 of us IFEMED Alumni led a collaborative Medical Mission to Ife Kingdom and Osun State ; during the 2 missions, over 10,000 patients were treated, 100 cataract surgeries performed, 5,000 reading glasses handed out ; numerous general surgical and dental procedures conducted! I salute Drs Fawole and Mrs Fawole, Dr Nasser, Dr and Mrs Popoola, Dr Jagun, Dr Olafiranye, Dr Okunola, Dr Rufai, Dr Wasiu Akinade, Dr Ilupeju, Dr Ogunrinde, Dr Fakiya, Dr Oluwole, Prof Fatusi, Prof Adeoye, Dr Mapayi, Dr Orafidiya, Dr Gabriel ;I salute all our collaborative foundations and our ground teams who made it possible for us to achieve seamless and resoundingly successful medical missions 2 years in a row! God bless your efforts! Fellow alums, this is a call to action! Let’s upgrade our current IFEMED alumni account to IFEMED Alumni Endowment Fund; donations to this fund should be ongoing and year- round! We can grow the Fund through annual levy on members, dedicated fundraising activities; individual and corporate solicitations and corporate sponsorship of events; alumni - organized conferences, conventions and exhibitions. Such a Fund should be managed by a committee of our alumni from different class groups.This way, we can tap into the Fund to assist with projects, scholarships as well as sponsor internships, externships etc.Let the fundraising start right now! I urge you to please donate frequently and consistently; give back always! All fundraising must be open and transparent in real time!Please help me reach at least 250 alums to raise at least $250,000!

Jacques Dufresne ,"Plaster Rock, NB",Other,"This is our StoryMy dad passed away in July 2004. During the year that followed, my mom begged me many times to go and live with her because my siblings and family members were not visiting or taking care of her. Moving back to MontrealIn July 2005, I went to live with my mom. The apartment next to my mom’s was available but I had to wait about 6 months because of renovations. I took care of her and was there for her. I prepared her meals, brought her to doctors visits or anywhere else she needed to go. I spent time with her and talked a lot with her. She had problems but I couldn’t find out or see what was coming up. On Mother’s Day of 2008, she asked me to take her to the hospital. We got there at about 4:00pm and it was only at about 10:30pm that they got her in to check her. She had to wait all those hours in the waiting room. The doctor couldn’t tell exactly what it was but said he had to get more testing done on the brain. The next day they told me that she had lung cancer that went to the brain. She also had a dropping bladder for more than 10 years that had caused infection all around and was very painful. My mom had 4 to 8 months to live depending on if she got treatments or not.My mom died on July 2008When she passed away in July 2008, I wanted to come back to the United States. Moving back to the United States I went to the border and explained everything to the agent. (My green card had expired just a little while before July 2005). The agent told me that if I did everything he told me that there shouldn’t be any problems in getting the renewal of my green card. I crossed the border about 5 or 6 times and every time they held me about two hours for questioning. They gave me my expired green card and said to show it every time I crossed. On one of the crossings (About October 8, 2008) the agent on duty took me outside and handed me my papers and said that because my green card was expired he had to let me go in as a visitor instead of a resident. I did not know all the meaning of  that until later. Finally in February 2009, I made the final crossing. I told the agent that I had done everything they asked. He checked and told me that everything was fine and wished me a safe trip. I crossed the border with my pick-up truck and a loaded 16 ft cargo trailer in 10 minutes. Never at any time have I crossed the border illegally.When I got to Florida, I emptied all that I had in a storage unit and headed to Tennessee to help my x-wife empty her apartment and move all her belongings to another storage unit. (We had gotten divorced somewhere in July 2006). Then I went back to Florida and bought a used mobile home fully furnished and started to work on a publication for French Canadians in Florida. Denial of the Renewal of my Green CardAbout 8 months later, I got a letter from the INS (Immigration Office) saying that the renewal of the green card had been denied. It was final and no appeal. The reason they gave me was because of a single crossing as a visitor. Then I understood that I had a problem but I didn’t know to what extend at the time. I have never asked to go in as a visitor, this was the agent’s decision. On the same day I went to the immigration office and tried to have an appointment or at least a contact but was never able to get that. I tried many times and even tried to call them through the central number but without success. I put the mobile home up for sale, it sold in one hour with 75% loss. I had a big stamp collection and started to sell everything at loss just to be able to retrieve money. About a month later, I loaded all I had left and headed for Tennessee. I was very discouraged. I then got an apartment and started setting up in Tennessee.Consequences of the denial of my Green CardI couldn’t drive.I couldn’t keep my postal box which I had for more than 12 years (I was getting mail from all around the world).I couldn’t work.I couldn’t get my Social Security, (I was qualified for it but couldn’t get it without the green card).I couldn’t open a new bank account.I couldn’t get legal aid without the green card.And more.... And we both couldn’t afford medical or dental. My wife couldn’t pay her medical bills.It has been a nightmare since that day. More problems adding regularly, all because of the denial of the renewal of the green card.We got remarried in Pastor’s Office on Feb 26, 2013. My wife was born in the United States. I am a Canadian.My wife’s diagnosis of cancerIn the months before, my wife started to have visits to see the doctor for pain in the leg and formation of a blood clot in the right leg. On New Year’s Eve of 2009, we went to the doctor and after more tests, she was diagnosed with colon cancer and had to be hospitalized immediately. We headed from the doctors office to the Hospital. I was hurt again. I didn’t want anything to happen to her and didn’t want her to die. I stayed at her side and went to all doctors appointments and to all chemo visits. She came and lived in my apartment and I took care of her. It brought us back closer together through all this. Now we had another joint problem. She couldn’t work for medical reasons and I couldn’t work without the green card. We had to live on the money I had and pay part for all doctors visits. I lost all the remaining of the money I had. My truck was half paid in the first year and I had to return it to Canada. I couldn’t refinance it, I couldn’t sell it and I couldn’t pay the balance cash anymore. The vin # was not in the US system. My wife needed me to stay with her in the United States. Some months later, my wife was able to get her Social Security. That together with the money I made selling my stamps and collectibles, helped us to keep a roof over our heads.One person’s decision that was FINAL AND NO APPEAL.We both are 70 years old. We need help to get our lives back. We are in Canada now. Without help, we will never be able to rise above this situation. We are trying very hard, please help us. If we cannot get over this problem, we will have to live one in the US and one in Canada and visit occasionally. That is not how a married couple lives. We need to re-file each on our side but we cannot afford to do that now. At our age, we need to stay together.Summary Because I was unable to work over the last 10 years, we had to live on what We had inherited and saved. We have lost over $125,000. plus $25,000 that my wife had without counting the Social Security or the money I could have earned. Also all the stress and the worries and the pain that we had to go through. We couldn’t afford the laundromat all the time, so my wife hand washed our clothing. We also wore our clothing over and over again. We couldn’t afford to wash our bed linens or towels very often, we only did that every two or three months. In between, we shook it outside, and used alcohol on it so we wouldn’t get bed bugs or scabies.Going back to CanadaI am back in Canada with my wife. We were planning on resolving everything such as driving license, medical, passport, federal retirement etc. within six months but, surprisingly, it did not. Our passports were resolved fairly quickly. My driver’s licence took about 7 months (Waiting time from eye exam to glasses and appointments and tests etc). We are still working on everything else.My wife is working on her (Canada Residency) papers which should cost about $2,000.00 However, someone told her Canada would tax her US Social Security. I believe re-filing for a NEW US GREEN CARD could cost about $2,000.00 also. We have contacted the CANADA SERVICES and the US CONSULATE in CANADA. I am working but unable to handle more than 20 to 25 hours a week. It is only enough to pay for food and necessities. In other words, in order to resolve our huge problem, we need help. We don’t know where to go or what to do. In 2008, the Border Crossing Guard made a decision that has caused us to loose everything we owned and every penny we had. It’s almost impossible. We are mentally and physically worn out from dealing with this problem. Both of us have chest pains. We cannot get medical coverage until all legal issues are resolved. My wife needs to get checked to make sure the cancer does not return. She has a chemo port in her chest that has not been flushed for almost seven years. She also has four or five abcessed teeth. The dentist recommended she get them removed a year ago, but we could not. I am working but it is work a younger man should do. I cannot easily get a job anywhere at my age. If I could work in an office, it would be good. But now I have a hearing problem that needs to be addressed. Every penny we had saved to buy a house, start a business, have a decent vehicle, and medical coverage is gone. We are hoping that there are a few people who will help us rise above this situation.","May 2, 2019",0,"$25,000 goal"
Scott Groen ,"Winnipeg, MB",Other,"Fatmata Kargbo and her two boys have requested sanctuary to avoid deportation and are living in our church while we help them find a safe and legal resolution to their immigration issues.Fatmata came to Canada in 2016 with her husband and two sons to attend a wedding.  After the wedding, her husband returned to Sierra Leone, while she and the boys continued to visit friends in Winnipeg.  Back in Sierra Leone, he divorced her, remarried, and sold/gave away her possessions.Fatmata has worked up until April of this year at the CanadInns Polo Park.  The boys have attended schools in the St. James area since 2016 (including Athlone, Voyageur, Crestview and Hedges), and they all have been a welcome part of the Crestview community.  They have attended Crestview Fellowship since 2017. Immigration Canada does not feel her case is strong enough to warrant either refugee status or for her to be allowed to stay on Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds. We believe that at this time, it is not safe for her to return to Sierra Leone. Fatmata's legal appeal failed and she was issued a deportation order for April 11, 2019.  She has requested and received sanctuary at Crestview Fellowship Church since this date.  The family now cannot leave the property.  The boys have been blessed to have the ability to attend public schools for now.  The church is working with legal help from a Winnipeg-based lawyer to challenge the Immigration Department’s decision in federal court, and to allow the most recent legal appeal to be re-examined.   In the meantime, the church is supplying for the legal, medical and daily needs of this family.  A shower has even been installed in the church!   Anything you can donate to help offset  these ongoing expenses would be gratefully accepted!  Below is one clip of the four that were shown recently on CTV, CBC and City News.https://winnipeg.citynews.ca/video/2019/06/09/dodging-deportation-inside-a-church/We are hoping to raise $10,000 to cover the legal costs and to help with the expenses of day to day living for the Kargbo’s.","June 18, 2019",$650,"$10,000 "
Tim Horner ,"Ardmore, PA",Other,"On June 10th 2015  I will set out to ride across the North American continent on a 145 cc Bajaj Chetak scooter from Phildalphia to west central British Columbia, Canada. I am doing to oppose TransCanada's plans to build piplelines across the unceded indigenous lands of the Wet'suet'en First Nations in British Columbia, Canada. I will be in solidarity as a non-indigenous ally with the Unist'ot'en (one of the five families of the Wet'suet'en) at their action camp which is surrounded by British Columbia. I will help them patrol their lands and build permanent structures designed to prevent TransCanada from building pipelines which will compromise their way of life by colonizing some of the last original lands in the world. You can ride with me by adding your support to this fund.  I will present your contribution along with your name to the Unist'ot'en when I arrive after two weeks of riding from the East Coast to the camp (3000+ miles).  Why the scooter? I know there is a ridiculous quality to this form of transport, but there are compelling reasons. First, I have been riding these scooters year round for the last eleven years. I know them very well.  Plus, I could not justify  the amount of fuel it would take to fly on a plane or even driving a car.  There is something compelling about the little guy driving down the throat of big oil.  They are bullies who justify their gains with the rhetoric of progress, but it is nothing more than greed and the colonial impulse to strip the land from its people. We will never be able to outspend TransCanada.  What we have is our bodies, but they are powerful. Bayard Rustin, one of the most influential but still invisible, organizers of the civil rights of movement in America once said: “We need in every community a group of angelic troublemakers. The only weapon we have is our bodies, and we need to tuck them in places so wheels don’t turn.”  This quote has  empowered me to  put my body into a place that will stop the wheels of aggression against one of the few remaining indigenous cultures in North America.I hope this will inspire you to become a part of this process. Even if you are unable to put your body at the camp, you can still contribute to the effort by supporting the presence of their bodies,  both physically and spiritually.Your contribution will be a statement of protest to the aggression of Big Oil and the forces of corporate colonialism.  Follow our ride at Twitter @DrTimHorner.Learn more about what the Unist'ot'en Camp","May 21, 2015",0,"$3,890 raised"
Shea Michelle Allen ,"Acworth, GA","Creative Arts, Music & Film","We need funding to pay for post production, finish the documentary and share this beautiful story.  Anything for a Fix is a documentary film that chronicles an incredible 3,000 mile journey from Key West, FL up the East Coast Greenway to the Canada border in Fort Kent, Maine. The ECOAW (East Coast Overdose Awareness Walk) began in January 2018 with five individuals impacted by the overdose death of a loved one and driven to changing perceptions about addiction embarked on this seemingly impossible mission. The Rage and Crow documentary crew filmed 150+ hours of video from one end of the country to the other - a remarkable combination of bad ass female filmmakers - myself (Shea Allen), Caitlynn Silvius & Jacqueline Clark. We encountered stories of addiction and loss as we followed the team up the coast; capturing unbelievable scenery and raw humanity in Key West, Miami, Daytona, Savannah, Charleston, the Outer Banks, Washington D.C., Baltimore and finally, the finish in Fort Kent, Maine in August 2018.THE BOTTOM LINE: For a year, the crew & I donated our time & resources. As owner of a small video production company, I invested everything I made - more than $15k of my own money - into production.  As the last of the budget ran out, my marriage abruptly ended and suddenly I was faced with selling my family’s home and scrambling to find a full time job to support myself and my two sons. With no alternative in site, I watched weeks turn into months and the hope of sharing this game changing film got smaller and smaller. I simply no longer had the time to dedicate to it between work and the responsibilities of being a single mom. But I think about it every day. It feels like I have a responsibility to finish it. I want people to know they aren’t alone in the overwhelming grief they feel watching a child or sibling fight addiction and ultimately fall victim to it. Brett & John were the most fascinating and transformative subjects, fighting stigma and stereotypes by simply sharing their stories and listening without judgement along the side of the highway. Megan, Abhay & Allison we’re gracious in their transparency and willingness to be a part of the story in the beginning and their internal journey fighting their own pain and addictions was equally challenging. Jessie finally found a foothold in recovery and is still walking as we speak on her way back down the coast to Key West. The growth, experiences, people and locations we captured astound me. It is an unbelievable story. I am so proud we pulled it off to this point! This group comes from all walks of life  but never met a single stranger along the way. They smashed stigma and judgement and started important conversations about addiction and grief and struggle. They battled self doubt, guilt, shame...heat, bugs, oncoming traffic, even one another and their own addictions. One foot in front of the other, one step at a time; camping roadside and accepting the kind offers of lunch or a bed to sleep in from people moved by their mission. Will you help? The film has been scripted but the task of compiling 150 hours of video into a 90 minute film is a huge undertaking. Since my day job is as a video editor, I know what it will take to finish the film. I need to hire two Atlanta based video editors who can commit to 20 hours a week for approximately 8 weeks - or full time for a month. I need them to be absolutely excellent in Adobe suite, own the software and computers necessary to handle the job. These folks aren’t cheap and charge around $30 - $35 an hour. Estimating 250 total hours of work to bring this film to life in a manner worthy of its subject manner, my cost will be just under $9,000.  I’ve set the goal at $10K to cover any additional costs of equipment, licensing and the listing fee to get the finished product to a distributor and into festivals. Please help me get this beautiful story told. In honor of all the lives cut short, stories left untold, children without parents and parents without children - we must fight the stigma that minimizes access to treatment, alienates survivors with shame and turns a blind eye to the greed of unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies.  #notjustanumberIf you don’t have it to give, you can help by sharing this on your social media sites. Start the conversation. Thank you to all of the people who have supported the film, the walk, Freedom to Grow and the mission from the beginning. Please know how important this is to me and that I won’t give up until its complete. Thank you for giving a damn.

Everlyn Gaupe ,,Community & Neighbors,"* DEAR MY FAMILIES &  FRIENDLY FRIENDS IN/AROUND THE WORLD, I APPEAL TO YOU ALL KIND HEARTED IF YOU COULD SUPPORT IN BUILDING A CARE CENTRE FOR THE ORPHANS, DISPLACED & HOMELESS IN PORGERA, WHICH WILL GIVE A 2ÑD CHANCE IN LIVE TO LIVE IN A PLACE CALLED 'HOME' *.Due to the giant Barrick Gold mining in Porgera, owned by Canadians & Zinjin, China, which is located in the remotest part of Enga province in Papua New Guinea, a third world developing country.  The biggest gold mining activities are done in the very hearts of the people, all the villages surrounds this monster company.  It is very painful living with this very thing which is continuosly breaking our hearts and tearing our bodies . We the people regret that if we had known the consequences of this, we would not have let it in the centre of our lives & also the company's biggest fault is 'Did Not Relocate/Resettle us where suitable to live' . We the Porgerans are known as Ipili Indigenous people. We have lost every things which were with us, surrounds us and which belongs to us. All our valuable properties gone, and are displaced everywhere, most villages were dumped and covered with waste chemicals tailings, the company don't have a tailings treatment dam,  it dumps waste direct into our riverine systems. Most villages and clans are no longer existing i.e Apalaka, Waiwanda, Kewainda, Ipatipi, Wakiam, Hupalika, Peyari etc... The very people with children who lived here are now became nomads, displaced and homeless.  The waste dumps: North Anawe, Anjolek, Kogai/Kaiya dumps eroded, y all these villages away and some burried. Few remaining lands: clans fought with each other for land and killed so many people among each clans 'why evil companies greed for wealth only' still lack resettlement.Many people socialised themselves with the dirty money which was paid by the mining company and involved in illegal activities and night clubs which ended up in HIV/AIDS, parents died, leaving poor children behind. Some parents died fighting over dirt money paid by company, some landowners died as illegal miners, some parents shot by police in the pits etc... All these issues caused many people and children homeless, displaced and many orphans have no hope so some joins in the illegal activities, most doesn't goes to school,  many people and children are hungry and thirsty etc.... .  Therefore, Porgera Women's Rights Watch have assissited them with clothes, bedsheets, bedcover, blankets, cooking utensils, eating utensils and food/water.  Also accommodated some of them, and assissted them to buy canvas, cells and some minor materials to build tiny hunts for them in some offcut state lands. In many occasions, I fight with government officials to defend my displaced people to continue to live on some state lands. which really needs a good heart to do all these so of life risking volunteer work (Self struggle). I took assistances and fundings from MISN, Protest Barrick, and most sweet individuals to do all these hardwork.. Please I need more of your kind supports to make this great centre. I, Everlyn Gaupe the founder & CEO of this newly formed organisation (Porgera Women's Rights Watch), I am a activist, defender and a advocate for more than 15yrs since when I was many times victimised my thes evil,  greedy companies. I was courageous enough to stand up for my young people since 1998 after my incident. I volunteers with our international partners i.e Minig Watch Canada, Human Rights Watch US, Colombia Law Clinic, etc... Currently, I'm a mother of (6) one drowned at the dump tailings into the river which is traditionally and today we still used as our footway for routine activities such as going forth and back to stores, marketing, gardening, shools, health care etc...Many of my clansmen/people washed away by this waste tailings which the company opens it to drain out it's waste, whoever still crossing the river below the steep, fast flowing sides would be carried away, living the loved ones behind undecided.... I took this initiative to raise funds for 'My People who are really suffering and homeless' to build a orphanage centre where they could stay and be educated and loved also have a find peace and learn some skills and knowledge on how to live into the future life....The money raised will involve in purchasing of a piece of land to build the centre, materials cost to build the centre, labour cost, transportation cost for materials, set up a school/training for life skills, pay the cooks, the cleaners, the securities, the trainers , etc. One day, some of you could visit the site/centre. Therefore, I am raising this fund to support my Ipili Indigenous community who have a bright future but just roaming on the streets of Porgera helplessly without plans to proper but just hunting for scavengers of food and stop those who are hunting for ramnant gold which they always hurt themselves and finally die... Please I appeal to my friends, supporters and fellow activist/defender/advocates around the world, if you think of me in this work, please donate a dollar to make this dream come true and also extend my awareness to many to sponsor or donate to this work... I depend on you, my dear friends, together we can make this happen. Thank you very much in advance for your kind help.Yours in human rights, Everlyn Gaupe-Ipili Indigenous People Activist (PNG)","November 30, 2018","$1,350","$30,000 "
Homero Barrocas Soares Esmeraldo ,"Oxford, South East England, United Kingdom",Education & Learning,"
(texto em português abaixo)Hello, my name is Homero, I am a student in Neuroscience at the University of Oxford (St John's College) and decided to create this project called CrowdEd, not only to fund my studies, but also to create an international network of people committed to  funding students worldwide with great educational opportunities by committing to pay forward to other students over the course of my career everything that is raised in this campaign.CrowdEdMany students in the world face problems funding their studies. This project aims to contribute for a solution to this. I will use the donations not only to cover my University fees, but also to create a project called CrowdEd. I am going to pay forward everything I receive in this campaign to other students in a similar situation over the course of my career. And I will help them create their crowdfunding campaigns with the same commitment of paying it forward to others. To fund the first year of my studies, I joined a similar project  in Brazil called ""Mais Educação""  (More Education, in Portuguese) and we have been very successful. You can check here the commitment contract  I signed at the time and will do similarly in this campaign.  We helped eight Brazilian students raise more than 60 thousand pounds and follow their dreams of studying in universities such as Harvard, Yale, Cambridge and Oxford. With this we proved that it works, now it's time to make it international. This campaign is the start of an international network of people committed to funding education of students with great opportunities. It's a collaborative fund based on the redistribution of the help received, and with the focus to fund education and research.With the growth of the network we will be able to create our own crowdfunding website, monitor if the person has contributed to other campaigns and notify the donors of his/her campaign every time he/she donates to someone and when the total debt is completely repaid. This system is complementary to study loans because they are not available for many overseas students. My storyI was born in Brazil, I love science and did my undergraduate studies in Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA) having a Diploma in Computer Engineering with Honourable Mention in Physics. It is the most prestigious engineering university in Brazil. During the last year of my course, I did a research internship at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne – EPFL (Switzerland) in the Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience of a prominent researcher in the field, Wulfram Gerstner. During this period, I was a student of his course Neural Networks and Biological Modeling. Due to my scores, I received a letter of recommendation:Link to the original letter: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1k8co3yijff88l6/EPFL%20-%20Wulfram%20Gerstner%20-%20Recommendation%20Letter.pdf?dl=0I participated as student in Latin American School of Computational Neuroscience and won the prize of best project.  I continued the research in cooperation with André Bastos, postdoc at MIT, and professors Ron Mangun e Martin Usrey, from UC Davis. The results were presented in a nanosymposium at SFN 2014 and as poster at IBRO 2015.This research experiences helped me be accepted to the program in Oxford (which was elected for the third year in a row the best university in the world). Check the acceptance letter .You can check my CV here.Research projectI am studying the learning systems in the brain. There are two regions with complementary roles on learning: the Cortex (thin superficial layer of neurons - yellow in the figure below) and the Hippocampus (in gray).  The arrows represent the connections between different areas.(Image from the article “What Learning Systems do Intelligent Agents Need? Complementary Learning Systems Theory Updated” from Trends in Cognitive Sciences Vol. 20, No. 7, 512-534. KUMARAN, D.; HASSABIS, D.; MCCLELLAND, J. L. 2016)The evidence suggests that the hippocampus is responsible for storing specific events and that the cortex is more involved in learning general structure using the memories in the hippocampus, connecting similar experiences together. An illustrative simplistic example could be the following. A child notices for the first time that when the traffic light is red, the cars in the street stop, and when it's green the cars move. In the next day, he/she observes the same again, but with different cars. In this case, the hippocampus would be responsible for storing the specific memories of each day, with its peculiarities, while the cortex stores the information that the red light is associated with the stopped cars and the green light with the moving cars. This knowledge is already interesting to know, but we still don't know what happens in the neurons that make us capable of learn using the cooperation between these two areas.In this project I am working to understand what happens to neurons and their connections to enable the complementary role of these brain areas.Why is this important? Research in this area has impact in Health by creating treatments for people with learning disabilities and also in Education, as understanding how learning works we can come up with better teaching strategies.Click here to see the research project as it was in February 2018 (4 months after the start at Oxford) and submitted to CAPES, one of the Brazilian funding agencies.The supervisor is Professor Tim Vogels  and the project is being pursued in the laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience located in the Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour . Prof. Vogels is affiliated to the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics (best department in this area in the world, according to QS rankings), part of the Division of Medical Sciences.COSTSBeing from Brazil, I am considered an overseas student and I have to pay £23,950 of annual fees (3 times the cost for home students). And about £900 for each month spent in Oxford, which I will cover by working. These figures are available here in the tab Funding and Costs.Unfortunately there are very few scholarships for Overseas students like me. As I mentioned, most of the costs of the first year I covered with a project similar to this one, but focused in Brazilian students . Now the second year is about to start and I need to pay the fees again. Over the course of this year, I applied to every single scholarship available, and the last result just came out a few days ago. As consequence of the financial crisis that Brazil faces, only one person in the whole country received funding for studying abroad from the last call of a funding agency called CNPq, and I wasn't awarded. And CNPq is one of the biggest funding agencies in Brazil. The other one (CAPES) also made drastic budget cuts and dramatically reduced the number of scholarships for students abroad. And to make things even worse the exchange rate between Brazilian currency and the British pound rose more than 30% because of the crisis.Average prices of things in Oxford (to give a notion of what you donation would be worth here in terms of living costs):

~£5 lunch at the Open market in Gloucester Green Town Square

~£40 electricity bill for a month~£100  all bills for a month (except for rent)

~£300 monthly living costs excluding rent and other accommodation costs

~£500 rent in a shared flat

£ 2000 is the amount of fees if divided by 12 months £ 8000 is the amount of fees per term (there are 3 terms per academic year)Without the help of this campaign, I will have to suspend my studies and go back to Brazil to try to apply for funding again next year.How to contribute: Step-by-step1 – Click the orange button ""Donate Now”2 – Fill your the amount, the tip for GoFundMe (minimum 0 in option other), and your personal info3 – Share it on your Facebook4 – Click ""Continue""Thank you very much for you support.

Este projeto tem por objetivo contribuir para solucionar isso. As doações serão utilizadas não apenas para cobrir as taxas do meu curso, mas também para criar o projeto chamado CrowdEd. Vou reinvestir tudo o que arrecadar nesta campanha em estudantes em situações parecidas com a minha ao longo da minha carreira. Irei auxiliá-los na criação das suas próprias campanhas de crowdfunding que será pautada pelo mesmo compromisso de futuramente ajudar a financiar os estudos de outros estudantes.  Para custear o primeiro ano dos meus estudos, eu participei de um projeto parecido  no Brasil chamado ""Mais Educação""  que tem sido muito bem-sucedido. Você pode ver o termo de compromisso que assinei aqui, farei semelhante nesta campanha. Já ajudamos oito alunos brasileiros a arrecadar mais de 300 mil reais e seguir os seus sonhos de estudar em universidade como Harvard, Yale, Cambridge and Oxford. Dessa forma, nós provamos que o projeto funciona e agora chegou a hora de torná-lo internacional. Esta campanha é o início de uma rede internacional de pessoas comprometidas a custear a educação de estudantes a quem foram oferecidas ótimas oportunidades acadêmicas. É um fundo colaborativo baseado na retribuição da ajuda recebida, focado em financiar educação e pesquisa.Com o crescimento da rede nós poderemos criar nossa própria plataforma de financiamento coletivo, monitorar se a pessoa contribui em outras campanhas de estudantes e notificar os seus doadores toda vez que a pessoa doar para alguém e quando terminar de pagar o compromisso assumido. Esse sistema é complementar a empréstimos estudantis que muitas vezes não estão disponíveis para estudantes classificados como ""Overseas"".Minha históriaNascido e criado no Brasil, sou apaixonado por ciência e fiz a minha graduação no Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA). Sou formado em Engenharia da Computação, tendo recebido menção honrosa em Física. ITA é uma das melhores universidades de engenharia do Brasil. No último ano do curso de Engenharia de Computação, fiz um estágio de pesquisa na École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne – EPFL (Suiça) no laboratório de Neurociência Computacional de um dos pesquisadores mais renomados da área, Wulfram Gerstner. Durante esse período, fui aluno do seu curso de Redes Neurais para Modelamento Biológico e, pelo meu desempenho, recebi uma carta de recomendação:Link para a carta completa: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1k8co3yijff88l6/EPFL%20-%20Wulfram%20Gerstner%20-%20Recommendation%20Letter.pdf?dl=0Já formado fui selecionado para participar como aluno da Escola Latino-Americana de Neurociência Computacional (LASCON). Meu projeto do final de curso recebeu prêmio de melhor projeto dentre os participantes. Dei continuidade a este projeto em colaboração com André Bastos, pós-doc no MIT, e os professores Ron Mangun e Martin Usrey, da Universidade da California, Davis. Apresentamos os resultados desse projeto em dois congressos internacionais: um nanossimpósio na SFN 2014 e em um pôster no IBRO 2015.  Essas experiências em pesquisa me ajudaram a ser aceito no programa da Universidade de Oxford (eleita pela terceira vez seguida a melhor universidade do mundo). Clique aqui para visualizar a carta de aceitação . Você pode conferir o meu currículo aqui . Projeto de PesquisaPesquiso os sistemas de aprendizado que temos no cérebro. Há duas regiões que tem papéis complementares no aprendizado: o Córtex (que é a fina camada superficial de neurônios que reveste o cérebro – em amarelo na figura abaixo) e o Hipocampo (em cinza). As setas representam as conexões entre as diferentes áreas.(Imagem extraída do artigo “What Learning Systems do Intelligent Agents Need? Complementary Learning Systems Theory Updated” da revista Trends in Cognitive Sciences Vol. 20, No. 7, pgs 512-534. Autores KUMARAN, D.; HASSABIS, D.; MCCLELLAND, J. L. Sabemos que o Hipocampo é responsável por memorizar eventos específicos e que o Córtex é responsável por aprender regras gerais a partir das memórias guardadas no Hipocampo, conectando experiências semelhantes. Por exemplo, um dia uma criança está na rua e percebe que quando semáforo está vermelho, os carros param na rua, e quando está verde eles se movimentam. No dia seguinte ela observa o mesmo fenômeno, mas com carros diferentes. Neste caso, o Hipocampo guarda as experiências específicas de cada dia, com suas peculiaridades, já o córtex armazena a informação de que o sinal vermelho está associado com os carros parados e o sinal verde está associado com os carros em movimento. Isso já é bem interessante, mas ainda não sabemos o que acontece nos neurônios que faz com que sejamos capazes de realizar esse aprendizado de forma cooperativa entre essas duas áreas.Neste projeto, trabalharei para descobrir o que acontece com os neurônios e suas conexões entre si para possibilitar essa ação em conjunto das áreas cerebrais.Qual é a importância disso? Um conhecimento como esse é essencial para criar tratamentos eficazes para distúrbios de aprendizado. Além disso, entendendo melhor como o cérebro realiza o aprendizado, podemos criar estratégias de aprendizado mais eficientes que as que utilizamos na educação de hoje.O orientador é o professor Dr. Tim Vogels  e o projeto será realizado no laboratório de Neurociência Teórica e Computacional situado no Centro de Circuitos Neurais e Comportamento (Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour ). Vogels é filiado ao Departamento de Fisiologia, Anatomia e Genética (melhor departamento da área no mundo, segundo o QS rankings), parte da Divisão de Ciências Médicas da universidade de Oxford.CustosPelo fato de ser brasileiro, sou considerado um estudante overseas (estudantes overseas são todos os estudantes não-europeus) e, por isso, tenho que pagar 23.950 libras esterlinas, em torno de R$ 126.935, por ano (mais de 3 vezes o valor pago por estudantes britânicos e europeus). Além disso, também terei que gastar cerca de 900 libras por mês, aproximadamente R$ 4770, para cobrir os meus custos de vida em Oxford, valor que pretendo cobrir trabalhando aqui (como fiz ano passado dando aulas de estatística). Esses valores estão disponíveis aqui  na aba de Funding and Costs. Infelizmente, existem pouquíssimas bolsas de estudo para estudantes não-europeus como eu.Como eu mencionei, a maioria das despesas do primeiro ano foram cobertas pelo valor que arrecadei em um projeto parecido com este, mas com enfoque em estudantes brasileiros . Agora o segundo ano está prestes a começar e eu preciso pagar as taxas de novo. Ao longo deste primeiro ano, eu apliquei para todas as bolsa de estudos que pude, e o último resultado saiu há alguns dias. Devido à crise financeira que o Brasil enfrenta atualmente, apenas uma pessoa no país inteiro recebeu uma bolsa de estudos para estudar todo o programa de estudos no exterior no processo seletivo do último edital do CNPq. E eu não fui contemplado.  E o CNPq é uma das maiores agências de fomento na área de educação. A outra principal agência (CAPES) também teve um corte drástico de orçamento e reduziu o número de bolsas de estudo destinados a estudantes de instituições estrangeiras. Para tornar o cenário ainda mais grave, a taxa de conversão entre o Real e a Libra Esterlina aumentou mais de 30% desde o ano passado devido à crise econômica brasileira. Média de preços em Oxford (para dar uma noção do que sua doação compra nos preços daqui):~£5 (R$25) almoço na Feira da praça Gloucester Green~£40 (R$200) conta de eletricidade por um mês~£100  (R$500) todas as contas (sem contar o aluguel)~£300 (R$1500) custo de manutenção por um mês exceto custos de moradia~£500 (R$2500) aluguel£2000 (R$10000) is the amount of fees if divided by 12 months £8000 (R$40000) é o custo das taxas a cada term (o ano acadêmico tem 3 terms)Sem a ajuda desta campanha, eu terei que suspender os meus estudos e voltar ao Brasil para tentar conseguir alguma bolsa de estudos para o próximo ano (Outubro 2019). Passo a passo para contribuir1 – Clique no botão laranja “Donate now”;2 – Preencha o valor da doação (será cobrado em reais no seu cartão de crédito: 1 libra é aproximadamente 5 reais),  preencha o valor de ""gorjeta"" para o GoFundMe (para doar zero, vá na opção Other), e seus dados pessoais;3 – Compartilhe no seu facebook;4 - Clique em ""Continue"" para finalizar.Muito obrigado pela sua contribuição.

Jody Black ,"Vancouver, BC","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","Hello my name is Joe Horrocks and I am a man on a mission to pressure the Canadian Federal Govt to introduce legislation to end the cruel and inhumane Canadian commercial seal hunt as well as promote The Global Citizen Charter IE:End extreme povertyFight inequality and injusticeProtect the planet  I am humbly asking for your support and seek to raise as much money as possiblefor my Journey for Change initiative. Every donation big or small is very much appreciated. All funds raised will be used to construct and build the Global Citizen Peace Ship and to facilitate the subsequent nation wide coast to coast Journey for Change Initiative. I propose to accomplish this mission by building The Global Citizen Peace Ship  and in July  of this year launching the Journey For Change initiative. The Global Citizen Peace Ship will be built as an elaborate and impressive version of a parade float that looks like a ship with a large mast with a massive peace symbol on the mast of the parade float ship. The ship will be built around a 24 passenger school bus that will be modified and constructed at my friends machine shop. I will then supply the ship with  Honda generators a large and powerful PA system plus a full drum kit miced to the PA system along with vocal mics and  Marshal amplifiers and speaker cabinets. The ship will be very diverse with attachable and changeable parts so that there will be the road legal version of the ship for travel between the Canadian cities we will visit and there will be the elaborate parade float version for when we pass through each major Canadian city. Once the Global Citizen Peace Ship is built my Band and I will drive the ship to st Johns Newfoundland to begin The Journey for Change initiative. The Journey will take us through the same cross country route originally charted by Canadian hero Terry Fox and his Marathon of Hope in 1980 and then subsequently completed by Steve Fonyo with his Journey for lives Marathon in 1985. The journey will start at the same spot as Terry Fox started near St Johns Newfoundland in July of this year and then finish in Victoria British Columbia in August or later depending on how much media and global attention the initiative can attract. The expectation for the mission is nothing short of historic and Epic and I believe the mission will absolutely succeed in serving as a lighting rod for Canadians coast to coast and the world community to have a unified voice to pressure Justin Trudeau and the Canadian federal govt to introduce legislation to end the Cruel and Inhumane Canadian commercial seal hunt massacre. As well as bring needed attention to the Global Citizen movement, its charter and mission. Before the June launch of the Journey for Change initiative I will issue a press release stating the missions purpose and agenda and I will at that time send a call out and invite every famous celebrity and performing artists of the world and most specifically Canadian celebrities and performing artists that are passionate enough for the missions potential success to come on board the Global Citizen Peace Ship in support and plug in their instruments and Rock out as we pass through each major Canadian city. Everyone will be invited and participation of well known celebrities and performing artist will certainly raise the level of impact and awareness for the missions success. As mentioned the Journey for Change initiative has a 2 tier agenda the first being to pressure the Canadian Federal Govt to introduce legislation to end the cruel and inhumane Canadian commercial seal hunt. and second to promote The Global Citizen movement and their charter. I will explain why I feel the urgency to take this aggressive action and why now is the time.    Why must the Canadian commercial seal hunt end ?Despite bans on the trade of seal products in many countries, Canada's commercial seal massacre -- the largest marine mammal hunt in the world -- still goes on each year. The hunt is inhumane and wasteful -- much of the demand is for luxury fur items, and most of the meat is thrown away.Canada is known to the world as a progressive, loving, great nation this barbaric madness is something that leaves a stain on the character of the Canadian people and many Canadians are vaguely aware or completely oblivious as to the extent of the inhumane atrocities being committed. But thankfully the word is getting out and public awareness is growing. I submit the commercial massacre of baby seals some no more than 3 weeks old beaten and sometimes skinned while they are still alive  is completely contradictory to what can be perceived to be in alignment with Canadian values? Due to global pressure the profits for Sealing are down considerably and the amount of sealers participating have gone from thousands to hundreds in recent years Thankfully it has become a disappearing industry that most nations around the world consider superfluous and barbaric.the tide is turning and as mentioned awareness is growing. The seal hunt is going to end and its going to end because of public and global pressure because its absurdly cruel.Why commercial sealing is cruelAs explained by the International Fund for Animal Welfare It is hard to portray just how cruel the business of commercial sealing is. The need to prioritize speed and profit, combined with an unpredictable environment makes it virtually impossible to ensure humane killing.Seal hunting in Canada .Each spring off the East Coast of Canada, hunters take their boats into dangerous waters or rush across moving ice pans in attempts to kill as many baby seals as possible in the short time available. Seal pups, most too young to escape, are either shot or hit with a spiked wooden club called a hakapik.Although the Canadian government compares the commercial seal hunt to the killing of farm animals, they have little in common. Unlike abattoirs, the commercial slaughter of seals takes place in an unpredictable, unmanageable environment where humane killing is impossible to achieve consistently.IFAW believes Canada’s commercial seal hunt can never be made acceptably humane. Here’s why:1                                                                                                                                                                                                         CCompetitive, commercial pressures make speed more important than humane killing. The seal hunt is effectively a race between sealers to collect as many skins as possible before the quota is reached. Sometimes as many as 150,000 seals have been killed in two days. Under such conditions, humane killing isn’t a priority and is rarely achieved.2                                                                                                                                                                                                         SSeal hunting involves unacceptably high wounding rates. When rifles are shot from moving boats at escaping seals or when the animals are chased across the ice pans with hunters swinging their hakapiks, it is unlikely a seal will be stunned effectively with a single blow or shot. Instead, animals are left wounded and terrified, lingering on the ice in pain, suffering and distress. Some seals are struck and lost.3                                                                                                                                                                                                         TThe current Marine Mammal Regulations do not set out requirements for humane killing of seals. Sanctioned hunting practices permit the most inhumane activities: live and conscious animals are impaled on steel hooks; seals can be shot at from moving boats and in open water; multiple animals can be shot before testing for unconsciousness, wounded seals may be left to suffer; and bleeding out is not required immediately after checking for unconsciousness. The requirements for humane slaughter are neither legislated nor practiced.4                                                                                                                                                                                                         EEffective monitoring and enforcement is impossible. Our over 40 years of seal hunt observation indicate that any regulations are impossible to enforce. Boats are widely dispersed over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, and hundreds, sometimes thousands, of boats take part. With only a few vessels available to enforce the hunt, officials face an impossible task.5                                                                                                                                                                                                         EEndemic disregard for the Regulations indicates the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is unwilling - and unable - to enforce any rules that might be in place. There is a clear conflict of interest in having the Department of Fisheries and Oceans responsible for enforcing the Regulations and at the same time defending the “humaneness” of the seal hunt.The evidence gathered by IFAW demonstrates that Canada’s commercial seal hunt is not conducted humanely and that monitoring and enforcement is all but impossible. Commercial sealing is inherently inhumane and seals - like all wild animals - should not be exploited for commercial gain.  I submit the commercial massacre of baby seals some no more than 3 weeks old beaten and sometimes skinned while they are still alive is completely contradictory to what can be perceived to be in alignment with Canadian values? 98 percent of the seals killed in the hunt are under 3 months old easy defenseless targets on the Ice. It’s time to step up and defend these majestic animals enough is enough it’s time to end this madness!  Its not a matter of if, its a matter of when and I am advocating the Canadian seals have suffered enough year after year the hunts demise is inevitable and needs to happen , so let the suffering and horror be brought to an end right now.I have started a petition at Change.org http://chng.it/rNDnYCc6bkMy goal is to collect 37 million signatures one signature for every man woman and child in Canada. I believe absolutely that  the weight of  overwhelming numbers on the petition combined with the public awareness and concern raised by the Journey for change. Will in turn force the Canadian federal govt to  introduce legislation to end the hunt.       I believe with a concentrated push from the majority of Canadians and members of the global community that also share the sentiment that these unspeakable horrors meted out on these defenceless majestic animals  must be stopped. The people collectively have the power and if the people organize and speak up the politicians will simply have no choice but to respect the wish of the people.what  is the Global Citizen movement and why is it  worthy of the support from my fellow Canadians and concerned citizens of the world.Global Citizen is a movement of engaged citizens who are using their collective voice to end extreme poverty by 2030, to fight inequality and injustice and to protect the planet. Through their mix of content and events, grassroots organizing and extensive reach through digital channels, they are building the world’s largest movement for social action. They organize massive global campaigns to amplify the actions of Global Citizens from around the world. I believe the Global Citizen movement to be a critical force for mobilizing the worlds population to taking the unified actions that absolutely must be aggressively implemented at this time as we draw closer to the point of no return where there won’t be a world left that is livable without intense hardship and suffering for all inhabitants of the earth both human and animals.  I’m proud to be Canadian and I love being Canadian also I believe we are all members of a Global community and I believe we sit at a historical crossroad, the ice caps are melting and species are being wiped out at an unprecedented and alarming rate. The evidence is clear. The Earth itself might go on just fine but we as a civilization are on the fast track to destruction and extinction through industrialized greed and a lack of caring and management of this earth that is our home. If we are going to turn the tide, the time for aggressive action to that end is now. This is the time in geological history when humans are the major force shaping the physical-chemical and biological properties of the planet. We are the force that is determining where the planet itself is going.  I believe the Global Citizen movement to be a powerful force towards ecological and social change as they gain more and more support from the global community.  I thank you for your consideration for support for my mission sincerely Joe Horrocks","February 16, 2019",$100,"$70,000 "

I'm going back to university!

I figure it's about time. After all, the first time I went was 30 years ago this year. (1989) I had so many things working against me.=====================================================(Much of this is a reprint of the article I wrote that got me into UVic. It's also pretty perfect to tell everyone where I came from and where I'm going)I was born in the wrong body, and because of where and when we are that meant educating family, friends, and others what ‘transgender’ is (and isn’t). I’ve had my challenges dealing with depression, ADHD and MS. I went to UBC for a very short time, majoring in things that held no real interest, and quickly left to join the military (where I spent 9 years). Since then I've owned 2 businesses and managed two others. I’ve had 12 careers in Canadian cities coast to coast. I’ve written 6 screenplays, and have seven children I've called my own. I’ve helped many others with their own challenges. I have a power wheelchair. That’s my past, but it doesn’t tell you who I am and intend to be. I want to be a leader, educator and innovator. I want to break down barriers and show people that regardless of where you come from, you are valuable and loved. Humanities isn’t just my declared major, it encompasses all of my passions! I want to be involved with shaping our future, to return our countries to where we should be as leaders in the environment, in caring about ourselves and others. I want my stories to spark the imagination of countless minds, because I think that the screen is good for more than just mindless entertainment. I want to debate with others so we can find the best future for all, because I believe we CAN make a difference and have an impact in the world’s future. I think that the world right now is at a tipping point between capitalism and socialism, and I want to be there to have a voice. I know that although I’ve learned so much since that naive 18 year-old left high school, there is so much I don’t yet know.  I want to learn. =================================================Now for a little Q and A:Why am I starting a GoFundMe? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Because of my ADHD, I need people to keep me focused and pointed forward. My unique way of doing it?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Introducing  THE PESTER PASS!  For as little as the price of a cup of good coffee, I'm giving you the right to check up on me.  Keep me on the ball. Nag me. Motivate me. Help me. Critique me. Ask me questions.I'll even submit regular reports. (Within reason: Daily reports aren't going to happen. :) Why am I even asking for money for this? --------------------------------------------------- Because it's been proven that once someone has given money to something, they take it more seriously, even if the amount of money is tiny.  It's hardwired into us, call it the greed factor. So I know that someone that gives even $5 is more likely to actually do it.What am I taking?---------------------------------------------------------Fall Semester:  Writing 100                                  Writing 109                                  Humanities 120A                                  English 146Spring Semester: Writing 100                                        English 147                                        Fine Arts 101                                        Humanities 120B                                        (probably one more course. Political Science?)What are my costs?---------------------------------------------------------Well, I'm doing much better than your average student in that because I'm 'permanently disabled', the government of Canada gives me a disabled pension, which is enough (with subsidized housing) to pay for my rent, food and bills (as long as I don't get crazy.) I even have a few hundred dollars every month to eat out.So, my costs will mostly be for tuition, books and supplies. Now, UVic isn't cheap so the tuition will be the lions share.First Year:My courses: ~$400/unit x 10.5 units = $4,200My books:  $1,000 (writing courses actually cost a lot less because the 'texts' are easily available books, for the most part. Also helps that my Huma 120 course I already had (and read about a decade ago) that text.My supplies: $600, but that should be considerably less in subsequent years.Total First Year: $5,800(Going forward, second year should be very similar to first year, with perhaps one more course. (estimate $6,100) Third & fourth year courses cost more, depending on the courses...I will know more when I get closer to that point. ($6,500 each year? Estimated total costs (VERY ballpark!): $24,900 (Still much better than the average 18 year-old who finishes a 4 year degree with a whopping $75k in debt.In case you are in sticker shock, I'm not asking for anything like that! I'm not past first year yet, and I haven't been to school in...a really long time. No putting the cart before the horse, as my Dad would say. (he was always fond of earthy statements like that.) There are also many grants, bursaries and scholarships that I can apply for, so I expect this number to drop down significantly, though I am probably too late to apply for them this year.What's the goal?---------------------------------------------------------My goal is to graduate with a degree in either Humanities (if I want to stick to being a generalist) or Writing (because I do love to write.)

In Closing--------------------------------------------------------Give as much or as little as you want.  The money isn't nearly as important as the contract this makes between you and I. Will you take this journey with me?Oh, and the very last thing?  I LOVE YOU! Everyone, all the time. Whether you contribute -  or not.  (Seriously! Don't feel pressured!)Whether I saw you last week or years ago. Whether you are friends or family, ex-lovers or one of my children, I sincerely care about you and hope for the best for you.  Have a wonderful week. :)  ==================================================(Also, about the upper limit - I set $25,000 as my 'pie in the sky' limit, as that would give me enough for both tuition and hair transplant surgery, my number one problem with being transgender. (imagine having to wear a hat literally every time you go  outside, for the rest of your life! I'm not a man, but that didn't stop me 'catching' male pattern baldness.)  I don't expect to get anywhere close to that amount, don't worry!)

Dear humanity, dear world leaders, dear ceo'sNo I actually don't want to engrave the ""achievements"" of our time on gold and on stone to warn and report the following ""humans"" or hopefully more conscious ""beings"" than we are at the moment, about our failures. I actually want everyone to wake up from their routine, to protest, to fight for our planet. Because there is no planet B! We can live in peace. So maybe I wake enough people up, if I engrave it for the records.Because I'm German, I am very precise, which means I will develop a list of all ""achievements"" of who was the world leader and which country was it, what could have prevented those events to happen and so on.Because I hope the world leaders/companies of our time don't want to be recorded as being part of this, it maybe brings them back to reality and makes them start actions. Because, if something gets fixed, the one who fixes it, will also be engraved.GO Donald! GO Angela! GO Xi! GO Emmanuel! GO Putin! GO Boris!I think we all have to make a step back from what we are doing right now.Our holy planet is in danger and most of all, we humans are.We are killing ourselves, we are the only species, which is capable of this gross event.There are at least 4 big threats to us, our freedom and our planet at the moment.1. Nuclear power/bombs - we have thousands of bombs, which are in hands of a few countries and their leaders. Officially to name are the USA, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France. De facto to name are Israel, India, Pakistan and Northkorea. Countries that may have some are Iran and Saudi Arabia. (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atommacht) Let's end this dumbness!2. Deforestation/Fossil fuel/Climate Change - Rainforests like the Amazon, Forests in Canada, Germany and so on, in actually every country in this world is at threat because of our greed for our shortterm agriculture for example meat and palm oil. As well as for our greed on fossil fuels, which on one side heats up our planet and puts CO2 into our atmosphere, which can not be absorbed, because we cut down our trees. We need reforestation and caring more about our ressources. 3. Food/Agriculture - most of all monocultures like soybean/wheat etc., pesticides, herbicides, GMO. They can lead easily to to global threats, if we relay on only very few seeds and fruits and overburdend soils and all those little chemical helpers. We need diverity.4. Plastic, all kinds of poisonous chemicals and pollutions that threatens us. Nuclear waste, garbage, clothing, DDT etc. If you don't know what I mean, have a walk outside with open eyes....Let's clean it.Let's all do every day a little step to world peace and be kind to each other. Clean up our garbage and take leftovers of others.I hope to be able to engrave that we made it as human beings to end those threats to ourselves. Everyone matters and everyone makes a difference.The Dalai Lama once said: ""If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.""Let's be 7 billion human mosqutios every single day. 

The money will be invested on engraving and, when something is left it will be invested in reforestation and renewable energies and other good projects for each topic so we adress every problem.

John Smith ,"Belleville, ON",Volunteer & Service,"These are my goals: Clear the debt my dad incurred by undertaking Harry's Last Stand for the last 10 years of his life which compelled him to travel the world and speak out against fascism, racism, austerity and to make refugees welcome.Complete his tour of refugee hot spots, so that I can complete his last and unfinished book on the refugee crisis.Complete the book I am writing about our life together over the last decade of his life which will take another 5 months of work. Build within a year a foundation in his name that will be run by professionals in social activism, refugee rights and political activism to inspire others by my dad's history and vision for better societies. To donate the copyrights of my fathers' books to the foundation, so that royalties from these books can be used to better the lives of others. My dad, Harry Leslie Smith,  spent the last years of his life when he was in his 90s fighting to end the refugee crisis.  He was dubbed the ""World's Oldest Rebel"" by the media for his never surrender attitude when it came to fighting against injustices. He used what time he had left on earth to warn people to not make his past our future through austerity and ignoring  of fascism espoused by Donald Trump. It was a sacrifice that he undertook with all his might despite the fact  that he was an ordinary pensioner with no wealth or political/media connections.  In the last 6 years of his life he wrote 5 books, penned innumerable essays while being interviewed by media outlets from all over the world. He put all his money and mine into fighting for the dignity of others and it left us in debt.In the last years of his life, Harry, with me acting as his caregiver, son and comrade in arms, travelled across Canada, Britain and Europe to make a last stand to defend the principles of a just civilization where all citizens have the right to public health care, affordable housing, education, proper wages and to be protected when made vulnerable by the cruel hand of fate.It was not an easy road Harry chose to take at the end of his life. In fact, he would have been much more comfortably off had he just spent his golden years in the pursuit of his own pleasures and comfort.But Harry believed in service to society especially when it was in peril, which is why in 1941 he joined the RAF to do his part in the fight against fascism. As his son and the person who was closest to him, I know his health would have been much better had he chose to take a backseat to the calamities of our time. He couldn’t though. So, despite pulmonary fibrosis, COPD and congestive heart failure, Harry Leslie Smith raged against the dying of the light through his books, tours, speeches, interviews and podcasts, while I acted as his faithful caregiver, best friend, partner and political collaborator. It was a privilege to serve and work side by side with him as he became the living bridge to the great and tragic history of the 20th century. My dad’s life began in the misery of preventable poverty and he was hell bent on ensuring that other people would not experience his hunger and despair. Harry was a light of hope in a world made dark by austerity, war and the greed of the 1%. Unfortunately, his sacrifice in later years and my devotion to him have now ironically left me in a tough financial situation because as he was not a professional politician, an academic, a person of wealth, just simply an ordinary pensioner, his Last Stand impoverished him and me.It’s why I desperately need your help to keep Harry’s legacy alive and complete his Last Stand. I need to clear our debts to preserve his memory and within the next 12 months establish a foundation in his name to perpetuate his legacy; so that others may continue on his work. Moreover as I have grieved his death, I have continued on his Last Stand while completing his book on the refugee crisis as well as writing a separate book about our last decade together. With the death of Harry, I have no family left and  I fear that without your support and love, all my father’s efforts and mine to keep him alive will have been in vain.Your money will be initially used to clear Harry’s debts and prevent the bank from assuming the copyright on Harry’s books. They will be used to further his Last Stand project that have continued doing in the wake of his death. Once the debts are cleared a foundation will be established that will have people who believed in Harry’s Last Stand and are luminaries in human rights, refugee rights and anti-austerity advocates sit on the foundation’s board of governors.Know that whatever you give, your generosity will cement Harry Leslie Smith’s legacy until Britain, Canada and the rest of the world become a place of dignity for everyone.

Peter Strong ,"Arncliffe, NSW",Community & Neighbors,"This fundraiser is an attempt at countering the all-pervasive media murder that the Murdoch empire has carried out and encourage the growing chorus of dissent into some action. We will produce a booklet and stickers encouraging for starters an Inner West Boycott of all Newscorp publications.  Stickers can be put on actual newspapers in cafes lampooning the propaganda and lies, whose up for a bit of coffee stop activism? also stickers and posters in the street. A 12-page booklet-zine will outline why we should take action and boycott Newscorp. These will be presented to cafes to encourage them to not stock Newscopr any more. The link between corporations and mining companies and government and media can be obviously seen in Murdoch's tabloid press here and overseas. The way Newscorp is presenting Scott Morrison and the LNP in our current Bush Fire crisis is counter to the growing chorus of anger against their ineffective rolling out of emergency measures as well as their defunding of fire services just before the crisis took hold. It's heartening to see so much dissent and sharing of articles and stories online and I would hope that this leads to some major anti-Morrison/Murdoch/Mining industry action around Australia in 2020.Scott Morrison won the election in 2019 mostly due to the massive propaganda that the Murdoch Mordor empire disseminated as well as Clive Palmer's campaign encouraging people not to vote for Labor. For years we have opposed the powers that be with their short-sightedness and greed, we have build up our communities with direct action and shared positivity with events, dances and online extended families. We weathered the Howard and Bush era's and breathed a brief sigh of relief when they were voted out and things turned slightly towards more conscious regimes.Now it seems apparent that the whole Labour/Democrat vs Republican/Tory/Liberal in the Western world has shifted to the right in order to panda to the sensibilities of the media who it seems are increasingly controlled by corporate interests. Now we have three dangerous men at the helm in the U.S.A, U.K and here in Australia.The Murdoch media machine has had a big part to play to manufacture public opinion in Australia, the U.K and U.S towards election outcomes favouring corporate interests.Countries like Canada and New Zealand where Murdoch press does not have a monopoly have left-leaning leaders, in the US, UK and Australia this is not possible as the press is so pervasive and bias towards the right-wing and its determination to drive us all off a cliff on the highway to hell. The ball is well in motion for interactive online media and a more level playing field in the ever more growing web where we all have a more informed voice but with FaceBook becoming more corporatised and targeted marketing during elections a step back has been experienced as we witnessed in recent Australian and UK elections. The potential exists for a mouse-driven democracy and decision-making process that will keep the pond of politics from going stagnant in the future but we're far from where we need to be to prevent the slide to a toxic planet for the future generations to inherit.The Morrison government is an embarrassing expression of Australia. Now is the time to get this conscious party started and take control of the future, What we have witnessed int he last decade are sad last-ditch attempts for control in changing times by the older generation, right-wing and mining lobbies who are desperate to channel wealth in the hands of the few at the expense of the quality of life for the future generations.Funds raised from this campaign will go to making stickers, posters and a booklet encouraging people in venues and cafes not to stock NewsCorp publications.","January 4, 2020",$840,$800

Echegaray Davies to fulfill his dream: Walking the 3 Americas (“CaminataLas3Americas”)  PLEASE JOIN ME IN THE QUEST TO RAISE $6,000 USD IN SUPPORT OF MARTIN E. ECHEGARAY DAVIES’ “WALK3 AMERICAS”, AN EXTRAORDINARY PURSUIT TO WALK FROM TIERRA DEL FUEGO, ARGENTINA TO ALASKA, USAMartin’s “CaminataLas3 Americas” is an extraordinary endeavor.  It is first and foremost a personal challenge born, as he puts it, “on the inspiration of his Welsh ancestors crisscrossing Patagonia on foot”. He began this trek pulling his 140kg (309lb) “cartcot” with his belongings on October 31, 2017 in Lapataia, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.  After visiting the 23 provincial capitals of Argentina, an almost 10,000-kilometer (6,200 mile) endeavor in itself, he continued on through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. On June 11, 2019 he reached the town of Guasuale at the border between Nicaragua and Honduras in Central America after walking a total 17,315 kilometers (10,822 miles) at a bit more than halfway to his destination in Alaska. In past years Martin has done other walks including a 2,200-kilometer trek retracing Governor Luis Jorge Fontana and his Welsh Riflemen’s expedition in 1895 from the first Welsh settlement of Rawson to the Andes Cordillera which resulted in the founding of Colonia 16 de Octubre, which today is called Trevelin, Chubut. It was during that walk in 2016 that I met Martin on Route 40 when I was touring western Patagonia. I stopped to greet him and while helping him chaging a damaged tire of his “cartcot” I learned about him his dreams and his friendship with other Patagonian welsh descendants related to my wife. My admiration and respect for this resolute man, taking on incredibly physically demanding challenges to fulfill his dreams, grew stronger when he began his “CaminataLas3America” trek.  It takes a special individual to leave everything behind -family, friends, comfort, etc.- to undertake an estimated 30,000-kilometer (18,700 mile) walk. Since his departure I have been in constant contact with Martin; assisting and encouraging him from the distance. He definitely deserves all the help we can provide.Martin is a 61-year-old proud descendant from the first Welsh settlers in Patagonia arriving in the Mimosa in 1865. Born in Trelew, Chubut Province, Argentina he is also proud of his upbringing, working with his dad as a field hand digging water wells and mending farm fences in the Lower Chubut River Valley. To date, Martin’s journey has been almost entirely supported by the kindness and generosity of the people he finds along the way who provide food, small donations and, in many instances, shelter. Most importantly their admiration and those from his thousands of Facebook followers provide valuable encouragement to Martin’s incredible feat. However, he needs additional funding to cover incidental large expenditures .The $8,000 USD Fund being raised is to help Martin with the following large anticipated expenditures:1-    Emergency medical expenses 2-    Replacement parts for his “cartcot”, phone and its components, and call/data cards  3-    Lodging when not provided4-    Clothing and footwear    5-    Occasional local transportation (i.e visa interviews in other cities) 6-    Return airfare for him and his “cartcot” to Argentina once his trek is completeYOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY SUPPORTING MARTIN IN HIS “CAMINATALAS3AMERICAS” .

Ken Williams ,"Southern Harbour Pb, NL","Medical, Illness & Healing","*** Please help us and Baby Jade raise money so she get can the proper medication/ supplies and hopefully a wheelchair xo thank you everyone I’m going to tell you a story of a Christmas miracle of 2016. My boyfriend Kenny and I where excited to start our family we already had the names picked out, In February we got our positive pregnancy test! Everyone was soo excited. My family, job and friend where so supportive they all came to the gatherings and we found out we where having a little princess (Jade Lillian Williams) all of our friends showerd us with gifts and love. On November 7th 2016 I was 39+5 weeks at 7:07 pm Jade was born!!The emotion that came over me was so powerful, I finally got to meet this little person I felt kicking me for the past couple months, It was instant love. We went home from the hospital and the nurse said she did a full check up and Jade was fine.. but that wasn’t the case. When Jade was only 9 days old I noticed she wasn’t acting right.. sleeping all day not waking up to eat, I followed my mother instincts. We brought her to the hospital where she was born and then shunned us away said “She’s fine” 2 days later she starting having seizures. It was the soo scary we rushed and got in the car. Now where I live there’s a fork if you go Left ( you go to town big Children Hospital 1 1/2 hrs away) Right ( 45 mins away where she was born) we choose the closets hospital for her sake. When we got in to the hospital and just before I laid her on the bed she coded in my arms ..she went blue this was the hardest thing I had to go through . If we decide to go the the Children Hospital we would of lost her half way there ... So the emergency crew did everything to keep her alive she was barely hanging on and no one knowing why she’s so sick. They called the children specialist to fly over to get her we had to wait 12 hrs because it was so foggy. During that time we blessed our child Hoping she would pull through. Finally the team came and took Jade to the big Children Hospital and I was right behind them, they told me we wouldn’t be able to see Jade right away they needed to do tests they warned us when we do see her it won’t be a happy sight  so finally on November 11th we where able to see our daughter, as we walked In to the room my heart broke every inch of her had IVs, tubes, monitors ect .. I wasn’t even allowed to hold her. During this time we had no answers yet it took days for the results to come back. Then one morning they called us to come in for a meeting the results where in. Our whole family was there in a room of 8 doctors.. they found out Jade had contracted Meningitis but not just any kind it was soo soo rare they had to double check they said it’s like two types of meningitis formed in to one. It’s called ( Haemophilus Influenza Bacterial Meningitis) the top Neurologists said he hasn’t seen this kind in Meningitis for 20 years the child died so they couldn’t get much testing done they couldn’t learn from it. So that being said Jade was writing her own story and they where documenting everything and sending her samples all across Canada. This infection was building up fast in Jades brain they took ever antibiotic and hooked it up to Jade hoping it would slow it down and eventually stop the damage it was causing. It took a couple days till they finally found the right one that will help her.It was November 18th ( The fathers Birthday) we got a call again.. this time they sounded very sad I was soo scared I didn’t want to go In to the meeting I cried I didn’t want to hear the words I thought they where going to say. But u had to go in and my family was my support.. this time as we all walked in there was 12 Doctors/ nurses in that room and I froze I knew it wasn’t good. As I say down they all struggled to talk knowing it was hard to say.. finally the Neurologist said when Jade was 9 days old and she coded in your arms it was from the Meningitis.. the Meningitis caused her to have a catastrophic STROKE  this took out half of Jades brain.. then he said we couldn’t get The infection under control fast enough, the Meningitis ate and destroyed the other half of the brain. (Jade only has 5-10% brain function left) everyone in the room was speechless, at the time I didn’t understand what that would mean for my daughter untill he explained. The Neurologist said she wouldn’t be able to do anything just bedbound.. no emotion no feeding ,. Or breathing .. she most likely won’t make it.Then my world crashed around me .. I didn’t eat / sleep or talk for days, I lashed out at people that love me I just didn’t understand why me why Jade .. All I did was finally hold my daughter as I cried. Weeks went by and it was soon Christmas the doctors said “ come with me plzz we have bad news, he said do you want to sign a DNR .. “ This is when we heard Jade wasn’t going to make it ...Our hearts broke ..I went in a held my little girl and told it ok to let go we had a mother/ Daughter bond .. she was very weak. Me and Kenny didn’t want Jade to suffer so yes we did sign the DNR (only because they thought Jade would only live on tubes and that no life for a child) We wanted Jade to fly back home with the Christmas angles if that what she wanted. So the next morning I called the company “ Lay me down to sleep” they take pics of babies that will soon pass. And then we had a super special visitor it was Santa!! When he came in to that door my heart filled with joy, he was so happy he brought happiness to our family at the saddest of times. I asked Santa to please hold Jade and kiss her on top on the head and he did , I knew it was hard for him but that just shows the big heart he has. Santa loved Jade soo much and gave her a special teddy bear for being so strong. He was sad that my daughter wasn’t supposed to make it, the pictures they took of the two of them is pure love. He was so fond of Jade he came back again to say a Payer hoping she would pull through this.That night I showed Jade a picture of Santa and her eyes light right up! I didn’t want to remember my child passing on Christmas so the whole family came together as I held Jade we took our pictures and then we took out her breathing tube ... no one should have to do that .. I was trying to be very strong through my tears .. she struggled to breath and I started to sing to her the song “ You’ll be in my heart -Tarzan” For one so small you seem so strong, my arms will hold you keep you safe and warm .. this bond between us can’t be broken, I will be here don’t you cry.  It was about 5 min in and we all thought this was it .. but Jade grabbed my finger with so was strength and love she was telling me she wasn’t ready to go. Me and Kenny held our fighting girl for 48 hrs and she was breathing on her own ! The doctors couldn’t believe it, then and there we took off the DNR if she wants to fight to stay with us I’ll do everything in my power to help her do so  it was a Christmas miracle!! Jade was alive to see her first Christmas she loved looking at the lights. And the NICU announced her 2016 miracle baby I’ll never forget that. A couple days later on Christmas Eve we got another surprise visit from Santa! I think he knew deep down Jade was a warrior! Because Jade was still alive and breathing on her own !! He was so happy I’m so glad Santa blessed our family, On January 12th 2017 we where sent home with our miracle baby We know Jades life will be full of struggle and it has been the past year, her diagnosis is full body CP fully handicapped, body is very stiff, she has sight impairment partly blind in one eye but can see 4 colours in the other red ,blue, yellow and green. She has many seizures a day epilepsy. And she can no longer eat by mouth she has an NG tube and will soon go for surgery end on January 2018, In the future she will also have double hip surgery to fix the stiff. ..But in saying all that my daughter is amazing is turned in to a wonderful happy baby that CAN See,hear, smile and Laugh!! With such little brain function they don’t understand how it’s possible but she understands certain things like my voice and touch, sounds, colours. The first time Jade laughed the whole house was In tears it was a deep laugh with snorts lol she was laughing over her poppy whistling!So here we are 1 year later Christmas and going in to the year 2018 and she spent her first Christmas home !! Jade will always have a hard time but she’s here and happy and not going down with a fight  she touches everyone around her xo This child is teaching me so much about life and how people take the small things In life for granted. To someone els a smile or there child lifting there head or eating is no big deal but it really is appreciated everything your child dose the human brain is magical keep God in your heart and faith everything will work out xo Thank you for reading the Christmas Miracles Of Jade *** Please Help us raise money for Jade so she can get her medication/ supplies and hopefully her wheelchair xo ","November 26, 2016","$2,073","$5,000 "
Bobby Brown ,"Blaine, WA",Other,"Update: I filed a 60(b) motion for fraud on the court with the Western Division Federal District Court in Seattle before the statue of limitations ran out on 2-5-2019. This is after after denial of my extension to file a writ of certiorari with Justice Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme Court before he retired. Judge Coughnenour denied the motion and I immediately filed an appeal once again with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal in San Francisco, it was accepted the next day.PeaceHealth St. Joseph's Hospital in Bellingham, Washington murdered my wife by telling Whatcom County responders she was DNR and husband was going to shoot them. When Gloria was in Peacehealth risk management employees forced her to sign a medical directive that authorized two doctors to initiate an illegal do not resuscitate order, ""DNR"", when she was drugged and incompetent, according to an eyewitness affidative, that's punishable for abetting suicide and murder. When she fainted two months later at home hospital security responders would not help us, fourty minutes later a whatcom county emergency responder brutally murdering her with a ""puncture wound over her internal jugular vein"", according to the UWMC autopsy.  Six or seven responders had turned and walked out, without mentioning a DNR or that I was accused of threatening to shoot them. I had to place my wife on the strecther myself, the first arriving two emt's tried but couldn't lift her up up off the chair. Once in the ambulance she didn't die for 35 minutes, despite responders claiming they witnessed her expire in the home and instead of going directly to the emergency room, only 20 minutes away, they sat in the driveway for 40 minutes and them claimed they administered CPR after they murdered her and half way to hospital, fifty minutes after they first arrived, alltogether taking 60 minutes to arrive. They covered up the puncture wound and never mentioned she had a PICC line that would completely eliminate any need for any puncture wound. Their ""internal jugular vein puncture wound"" contradicts the autopsy, while their run report only reports they did an intervenous in the EXTERNAL jugular vein, anyone knows they don't do intervenous in the neck, never imaging they'd be an autopsy. Death statute favors death over life, so washington state board of health turns it's back on violations which is an incentive to doctors and responders to kill a patient rather than heal them and face civil liability for pain and suffering or higher malpractice insurance costs. Ironically, if a person chooses to die by refusing resuscitation yet responders administer CPR and they survive by resuscitation, they have won in court from responders committing battery without informed consent and going against their wishes, yet here, no safeguards for a person who wanted to live with a directive for full resuscitation, they're dead and family's told they can't sue because Death with Dignity statutes eliminates criminal and civil liability. The statutes need to be revoked because they clearly cause confusion in those prescious few minutes when responders first arrive and refuses to help and promotes death by giving hospitals and doctors incentives to euthanize rather than heal for nefarious reasons.  How many could have lived had they not been euthanized after death statutes are enacted. Proponents of death with dignity even brag that once it's initiated nothing can stop it, families never find out their loved ones were murdered.I didn't find out till two years after Gloria's death from the Bellingham Police that PeaceHealth put the  DNR on her life illegally and directed responders to kill her when they realized that Bellingham Police investigated and Detective Scanlon found the accusations were erroneous and they falsified the death threats. Hospital security and risk management quickly realized they not only could be sued for the death threats against the hospital but also caught initiating a false DNR, plus reporting falsely to UWMC that Gloria was in excruciating pain and dying from leukemia. In those few seconds, they could have told responders to help her, instead they murdered her but discovered the PICC line and knew they were caught, that's obviously the reason for the big argument and fight at the birch bay firehouse and why Chief Anderson quit and responders that walked out made up story husband gave them a hard time and saying they had to remove Mrs Brown.Records were not available for two years regarding the death threats I allegedly made, they answered the haunting question why responders acted like they did, it infers whoever began the false rumors about death threats is guilty of murder as responder.No law firms would help us get justice, now after five years I've learned why. UWMC placed a PICC line on Gloria's arm just two weeks earlier, with that in place, perspective lawyers and doctors reviewing medical records could see there was no reason for a puncture wound with it in place, it proves it was an intentional deadly wound, there could be no other reason. Lawyers never told me, they knew it would be difficult prosecuting emergency responders. That's what people are left with in a ""Death with Dignity"" state where doctors, hospitals and medical personnel are protected from civil and criminal liability, albeit not tested for murder. Peacehealth never told us they had initiated Comfort Care double effect deadly drugs without informed consent, making it so Gloria couldn't move her legs or breath without oxygen. Gloria refused a DNR, yet they forced her to sign a medical directive authorizing an illegal DNR when she was drugged and incompetent without informed consent, later an eyewitness gave her affidative stating she witnessed hospital risk management employees force Gloria to sign the illegal medical directive RCW 70.122.030 which is a crime in itself and when forced is RCW 9A.36.060 for promoting a suicide attempt or RCW 9A.60.030 for obtaining a signature by deception or duress yet the board of health won't investigate. Illegally witnessing her signature, all crimes punishable by a charge of murder RCW 9A.32.030 for knowingly altering or causing life-sustaining treatment to be withheld or withdrawn and death hastened.  Chapter 70.122 RCW of the Natural Death Act contradicts homicide laws by supposedly removing criminal and civil liablity and getting close to making involuntary murder permissable when state fails to investigate, that is why I am challenging death statutes in washington state, they need to be revoked to save others from premature deaths.The illegal DNR was initiated by risk management employees under the pretense it was a medical directive for full resusucitation, yet the defense is claiming the DNR never exists in sharp contrast to fact that PeaceHealth admitted it issued the DNR, that it is standard hospital procedure that two doctors can issue a DNR. Perhaps in another country but unless the law has changed, they are required to secure informed consent from a competent patient, anything else is murder.Responders had no reason to be near that area of the neck, it would be absolutely redundant with a PICC line in place, according to authorities subclavian catherization is reserved for experienced doctors in a full equipped hospital in sterile conditions, absolutely not performed by inexperienced responders in the back of an ambulance on what was supposed to be a twenty minute trip yet took over a hour. Responders never mentioned the internal jugular vein in their run report, despite the UWMC autopsy reporting a ""puncture wound over the internal jugular vein"" they hid the fact they murdered her and tried to cover it up by claiming they initiated an IV ""intravenous on the external jugular vein"". External and internal jugular veins are two distinct and different areas, the external jugular vein is on the surface, the internal jugular vein is deep, next to the carotid and very dangerous to go near, there was no reason ever for an emt to go near, let alone puncture the IJV, again with the PICC in place, a second central line would be redundant and only proves puncture wound was an intentional mortal wound. It began with us going to see a Doctor Jennie Crews, she told Gloria she would die if she didn't take one hydrea a day and hid the fact her blood counts went up as a result of the infection, to make it appear it was caused by not following her directions. Gloria self medicated for thirty years and oncologists in california told her to keep doing what she was doing, gloria knew from experience if she took one hydrea a day she'd bleed out as she did once accidently and I told the doctor that she wouldn't do that, Crews reported me to APS. Meanwhile, Peacehealth Wound center had caused Gloria an infection after debriding a quarter size wound on her lower leg to supposedly make it heal faster. Doctor Sury changed the wound center prescription from keflex to cipro which immediately made it so she could not walk, it attacked her tendons, made her legs swell and made her very sick to her stomach. We went to the hospital for something for her stomach pain because gloria didn't want to go to Crews, she called her vindictive. The ER tried to get Gloria to agree to a DNR which she refused, a Dr. Bree Johnston, not an oncologist but palliative care doctor, refused to take no for an answer and boldly stated in the medical record the families beliefs were strange, that she'd come back when Gloria was thinking straight. Three days later they committed a criminal act and forced us by lying and telling us a medical directive was for full resuscitation as we asked for. They tricked me into returning to the businees office and they knocked her out with opiates. I found her in a room looking as though she was beat up. The nurses starting in saying she was in excruciating pain and dying. Without advising us of their plan, they began comfort care that I discovered later is part of the double effect euthanasia slippery slope agenda, it's claimed that once it's initiated nothing can stop it until they kill the person. Without telling us what they were injecting they admnistered deadly steroids and fluorides dexamethasone, predisone, levaquin, cipro and morphine that made it so she couldn't walk or breath without 24 hour oxygen. Several days later risk management employees came in with a medical directive for full resuscitation which I requested. I was told I could not sign because I was a spouse. Never dreaming it had anything to do with a DNR I didn't pay to much attention in fact I trusted the woman because it appeared she was doing us a favor by getting the papers together so fast for full resuscitation which I appreciated, meanwhile everyone was told to stand in the hall as they moved furniture into the room. By the time I learned from the eyewitness that she saw them actually force Gloria to sign it, it suddenly made sense now that the reason for forcing the medical directive was because it was not only for full resuscitation but was primarily to allow doctors to initiate a DNR without informed consent, I had been tricked, it was illegal in many ways, it was for life or death decisions, and having power of attorney, they had to know I should have been involved in those decisions. They created a state of confusion at the same time, a dozen people came in all at once, everything in the room was moved down the hallway to another room, even the bed and furniture. A friend of Gloria's witnessed gloria was drugged and incompetent and forced to sign by risk management employees, according to the eyewitness affidavit.  A woman hospital director told me I'd never take my wife out of the hospital alive, a doctor told gloria he would not change the bandage on her leg wound because she was going to die so it wouldn't make any difference, I told him to get out and not come back, he said he'd call hospital security if I changed the wound, I changed it and they called security who stood outside our room for an hour. When they wouldn't stop or tell us what they were administering we demanded to leave against medical advise. I took my wife to UWMC, they did their own tests and Dr. Tonnelli of their ethics committee discovered Gloria was not in excruciating pain or transferred over to leukemia as they were told by St. Josephs, that meant all the deadly regiment of comfort care drugs for excruciating pain that PeaceHealth administered to her without informed consent was all completely unnecessary, without those double effect comfort care drugs and the DNR and the murderous emt's, my wife would still be alive and able to walk and breath without 24 hour oxygen. Gloria asked to sign a medical directive at UWMC for full resuscitation and doctors recognized she greatly improved and was competent to make her own decisions yet the state registry for updating a DNR for the new directive apparently was never updated or responders never bothered to check. Irregardless whatcom responders had an obligation to help gloria, the state EMT Association told me that the only way they cannot help a person is if there is a POLST form, in fact they said to go after them, they only save lives, they don't murder people. The state legislators, state board of health, Attorney General's and Governor's office, the whatcom medical examiner, the doctor who signed her death certificate police and prosecutor should be investigating this crime, they all refuse. They're condoning murder and not protecting the sanctity of life when there's prima facie evidence laws and statutes have clearly been broken.For years,  proponents of Death with Dignity claimed this could never happen with the numerous layers of informed consent safeguards in place. People are supposed to be protected from injuries resulting from health care RCW7.70.030/050.  Death with Dignity and Natural Death Acts RCW 70.122 state it requires  informed consent from a competent patient or a designated proxy. Common sense dictates only a competent patient can commit doctor assisted suicide by agreeing to sign a medical directive acknowledging they understand two doctors will assign a DNR to not be resuscitated or give them a drug to self administer to kill themselves. The procedure requires a ""competent"" patient to give their informed consent before two doctors can issue a DNR (do not resuscitate order) on their life. Here, the two doctors never told us they initiated the DNR, only finding out about it two years after my wife's murder from the Bellingham Police. It immediately answered the questions in my mind why the responders did nothing to help my wife and turned and walked out, not helping her. I filed a civil complaint with criminal and civil causes of action in Whatcom County Superior Court and filed a motion for summary judgement allegeding facts, along with the eyewitness affidavit and a whatcom superior court judge refused to consider the facts and merits of the case, dismissed it. Case was appealled to Washington state Supreme Court which dismmissed the case without considering a summary judgement motion. First and Fifth Constitutional amendments that protect life and civil rights causes of action under the color of law were infringed, husband filed a complaint against four defendants, case was filed in Seattle Westen District Court, whereby it was also dismissed and appeal with the Ninth District Court of Appeals is ongoing with respondents reply to appellants opening brief has been extended by the Court to May 1, 2017.Washington State is not protecting the sanctity of life by allowing RCW7.70.060(5) to remove criminal and civil punishment for causing injury or death by contradicting long standing protections against greed, collusion and other nefarious actions. Proponents of Death Statutes repeatedly claim erroneously people do not have to worry since there are multitudes of safeguards and levels of mandatory informed consent rules in place to prevent mistakes or intentional murder. This case can overturn death statutes since Glucksberg stated they'd have to look at euthanasia again if one case of involuntary euthanasia was reported when statutes allowing voluntary euthanasia were in place.Death statutes in Washington state should be found unconstitutional, they allow staututory civils law to contradict criminal laws in both the United States and Canada that read ""no one can agree to have death inflicted upon them"", this case shows there's way too much wiggle room for criminal mischief. High Court decisions from other countries and provinces, Ireland, England and the Europen Court of Human Rights are deciding against assisted suicide, agreeing death statutes conflict with criminal laws. Yet, Washington RCW 7.70.050 still maintain the major safeguard is failure to secure informed consent, that it shall be necessary element of proof injury resulted from health care in a civil negligence case, yet doesn't elaborate on criminality, instead sending a mixed bag interpretation to ill-informed doctors and hospitals that murder can be excused, that's also dangerously misleading for the public. Despite stating this in my complaint, Whatcom County Superior Court decided plaintiff failed to demonstrate a cause of action and did not have standing, dismissing the case on a timeliness issue and procedural error 12 (b)(6)(5). The court failed to rule on my summary judgement that I filed twice, alleging and proving what St. Josephs did to my wife was not just against medical ethics but illegal and punishable with murder. Whatcom county Superior court avoided the statutory issues and dismissed knowing Whatcom County did not have clean hands. Laws were broken, only hypothetical sets of facts that can be adjudged by a jury are necessary to allow it to go before a jury. Bottom line, court or legislators should find these laws so disgusting they'll overturn Death with Dignity and Natural Death Acts forever. PeaceHealth Hospital risk management department learned to manipulate comfort care and death panels to circumvent informed consent using illegal witnesses and false DNR's. This case could save future lives that shuldn't be lost ahead of their time and be deterrent to those who take advantage of statutes to cover mischief and nefarious acts to avoid liability andinstead of following law, using it as no cost malpractice insurance. If our country allows this to continue we'll go down in history as the greatest nation who destroyed itself from within with euthanasia voted in by it's own people. The Pope gets a million dollars on each person's corporate name when they die yet goes around preaching falsely to the world that americans stopped trusting in God, an obvious slur to our Founders Constitution, twisting the truth by claiming it is our chose every person has not to believe in false doctrine over God's word, and to Choose Life over Death. Deuteronomy 30:19, yet choosing not to  respond to my summons. This case is the end day's version of the four horsemen, an ultimate demonstration of the anticipated switch from voluntary euthanasia to involuntary euthanasia warned about years ago by preachers and opponents of euthanasia. This would be a first impression case in Washington state where there's proof the patient wanted to live yet was deliberately overriden by a hospital and emergency responders who comitted murder.  Killing a competent person without securing informed consent with an illegal DNR malisciously fabricated when the patient was incompetent, then using the false medical directive to justify allowing two doctors, who never examined her, to issue a Do Not Resuscitate Order, that two months later hastened her death and took away her lost chance to live is plain murder. The hospital falsely accused the husband of making death threats to hospital employees and responders, a scenario of unspeakable magnitude, committed by both county and hospital employees with deliberate disregard to human life and statutory laws, with complete disrespect of common law and the sanctity of life.A case as flagrant and shocking to the conscience as this, should create a new category of criminal and civil medical malpractice called ""medical assisted murder"". If a party alleges and proves facts that the defendant either hastened death with involuntary euthanasia or failed to secure informed consent, or aided or abetted a suicide or killed with comfort care or DNR, it's murder. We need to erase the catholic torture chamber excuse called ""double effect"", out of state law that's straight out of the Middle Ages that's been killing millions with comfort care regiments of deadly chemicals doing one thing mainly, crippling the patient and destroying their ability to breath, either way the patient can then be easily euthanized by dehydration or by a junior nurse adjusting the flow or drip of the alleged medication or oxygen or a responder's puncture wound. States should have to be held legally responsible for death statutes that no longer protect the sanctity of life or it's citizens. I've requested an investigation from the FBI, State Board of Health, the Governor's office and Whatcom County Prosecutor's Office and medical examiner, the only one to help was the  Bellingham Police, who without their help I'd never have known of the DNR. The case has been appealed to the Washington State Supreme Court and set on the Deputy Clerk's motion Calendar on January 29, 2016. Case number is 15-2-01466-4, e-mail is supreme@courts.wa.gov and Washington Supreme Court dismissed case, a complaint was filed with the Ninth District Federal Court in Seattle, Judge Coughnoeur dismissed it on Oct 28, 2016, one day before he could warrant or deny my summary judgement motion. Husband appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, an extention was approved till February 28, 2017 for my Opening Brief. After brief is timely filed, respondents have 30 days and appellant has 14 days to reply. Appellant filed opening brief on March 28, 2017, there have been a couple of extensions, defendants have until May 5th to respond to my (appellants) opening brief. Appellant has asked Court of Appeals to find the District Court erred by not finding plausible facts proving fraud and concealment by Peacehealth and send the case back to District Court for trial or cert the case to the U.S, Supreme Court on the question whether a person can be involuntarily murdered under color of state death statutes.Court knows it's a substantial issue of importance to everyone and see a favorable ruling to defend life won't necessarily stop death with dignity, perhaps they want to see the U.S. Supreme Court rule at shutting down groups promoting death and euthanasia once and for all, they're lots of things going on in the country the average person doesn't realize, the truth has been revealed if you want to look for it,  everything we've come to believe is a scheme just like abortion and cancer, we've been tricked using the word ""choice"" by foreign jurisdictions that have always hated what the united states stood for, we've been ruling under sea jurisdiction called the United States of America INC, for 200 years, with headquarters in the District of Columbia, Washington, the Crown Bar in London, England and the Vatican by Pope Francis, what is happening today is no different than what during the holocaust in the medical field when hitler and mengele experimented and murdered millions of people, nazi's used germans, who were naive and affluent like us, convinced them their distorted view of eugenics was going to better the world. I asked the state for an injunction on both Death with Dignity and Natural Death Acts to stop killing under the color of state law in Washington State, that I'd settle without a penny, they should be on my side, yet refuse to admit the state has culpability for enacting death statutes despite them knowing it's a scheme to kill for nefarious reasons, we need to expose this evil. In 1997, the Supreme Court in Glucksberg said; ""one life to loose to involuntary euthanasia, when a state has statutes legalizing voluntary euthanasia, is one life too many, the law would have to be reviewed."" God Bless.Bobby BrownIn loving respect of my beautiful wife, Gloria Jean Brownbobbynorthlake@gmail.comhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/HASTENINGhttps://www.facebook.com/WeThePeopleWCJAJoin in your state and county and we can restore true common law juriesand get justice for our loved ones.","November 30, 2015",$130,"$2,000 "

Brett A Rogers ,"Canmore, AB",Business & Entrepreneurs,"IntroductionSeveral key laws that govern our economies favour the very rich! This has resulted in approximately 1% of the population controlling 99% of the wealth. Some of this 1% uses tax loopholes and manipulates governments to maintain and build their wealth, too often with disregard to the wellbeing of present and future generations. This is causing a lot of problems motivated greed and financial scarcity (poverty is an extreme example). Some say this situation is at the core of our world’s problems. As an author of these subjects, I can confirm that it is true.It is crucial that this problem be solved as soon as possible! Many good people have tried and failed. What I am purposing gets around and corners the 2 core obstacles: the limitations of our governments and their corruption. In brief, these projects are the selling of conventional products and services using For-Profit Non-Profits, and a sophisticated debate website with multiple features to help us design the future together, hold the corrupt accountable, and more.I’m Brett A Rogers. In 2003, I dedicated my life full time to the development of science-based strategies for enhancing the mind-body-spirit health and performance of individuals and society. I have presently authored 6 books and 1 textbook on these subjects. This campaign is to put together a team of experts and volunteers, as well as to collect funding to move these projects forward.Before getting into the details of these projects, let’s take a closer look at this fundamental problem.The Sad, Bad and TrueConventional corporations get to manipulate their tax returns so they do not pay any taxes. They also get to use 100% of their profits in any way the people in control choose, such as distributing it to themselves as raises and bonuses, which is typical. This is how most people people become mega-rich. In some countries, such as in the USA, once you become mega-rich, government corruption exempts you from paying taxes. These details are causing a multitude of problems everywhere on our planet, such as inflation, financial scarcity, psychological and physical stress, crimes and immoral acts motivated by poverty, crimes and immoral actions motivated by greed, and much more. This terrible situation has greatly suppressed the health and performance of the average person and all life on earth with such things as being a slave to worldly responsibilities to simply be alive, low food quality, environmental degradation, toxic pollution, all pollution, and of course climate change. We would be in a much better situation if our economies did not allow for greed to be tempted so significantly, and allowed to exist so easily. This is especially true for future generations because many of the problems are escalating. For Profit Non-ProfitsThe 1st solution I will discuss is the simplest: use Non-Profits to sell the products and services that greedy corporations provide. Unlike conventional corporations, Non-Profits are required to be ethical in several ways. They need to invest 60% of their profits into societal development projects and employees are only allowed to be paid a government set amount, which includes bonuses and company perks. When a consumer has the choice to buy from a Non-Profit at a similar cost, quality, and certification compared to a corporation that could fit the immoral description just mentioned, and more than likely does compared to the Non-Profit, the Non-Profit will win almost every time. If the consumer is sufficiently educated on the details of their choice, which many stores, websites and community members will help them become, Non-Profits will probably win every time!I plan to move in this direction with my Books, DVDs and Presenting. I also have a large list of Health Food, Supplement and a few other products, as well as marketing strategies that I have been developing along side my writings. I am looking for people to invest their expertise, time and money to get this Non-Profit functional and as independent of me as possible so I can focus more on designing and developing other important projects (see website for details).Once established, this Non-Profit will help other companies structure themselves in a similar way. As well, it will invest into priority societal development projects, such as those I discuss on my website.To put it simply, this concept will reduce and eventually significantly reduce the temptations and consequences of greed. If consumers primarily buy from Non-Profits, greedy competitors eventually fade away.Consider this:- Would Monsanto have manipulated the system to bring Roundup to the market knowing of the risks if there wasn’t tens of billions of dollars to be distributed among those in control?- Would natural cures and prevention know-how be ignored and suppressed if there wasn’t hundreds of millions of dollars to be made from patented drugs and medical procedures that often harm human health directly, indirectly (pollution) and often do not work as well?- Would synthetic chemicals be rushed onto the market without proper examination and due care concerning human and environmental health?- Would our government be as corrupt as it is if there was significantly less financial motivation?- Would global warming have been ignored as long as it was/has?- Would the quality of food and other products be higher?I’m pretty sure that you’ll agree, the answer is a firm NO!Using Non-Profits to provide conventional products and services is a wisdom we need to implement before greed ruins our planet and people any further. Get involved with your expertise, time and money today! We need to act ASAP!Please reflect on how significant this concept is before moving onto the next section; the next project is a bit more complex.The Global Debate WebsiteMaking good decisions sometimes requires input from large numbers of people. This can be a challenging and expensive task. Businesses and governments spend a tremendous amount of time and money trying to do this well, often falling short.An incredible solution to this is called the Global Debate Website (GDW), which I started designing in 2006. It is a sophisticated online platform that places hash marks (#) into uploaded word documents, presentations and videos to link specific sentences, paragraphs, sub-sections, sections and more to comment boxes. With several features that make it easy to skim comments, as well as encourage effective and efficient commenting from users, very large groups of people can contribute to the innovation of these uploads by voting on previous comments and placing their own if necessary. From designing products, business plans, policies, software and more, GDW will be the most effective tool available! User’s will have a status that involves several details that employers, funding sources, marketers, and other GDW users can use to find the people they are looking for to invite to comment on specific uploads, join groups, as well as for other reasons (ex. offer them an opportunity). This status can also be used to restrict access to specific uploads and groups. Good examples are blocking users who do not use the site appropriately or well, companies that only want to hear from their employees, investors or customers, and the government to only hear from academic experts on a specific topic or the people they represent (referendums could become more common). The GDW will be free to use, but utilizing user status details will not be. Selling target audience marketing and ad space will also be for sale. There is a lot of money to be made! Especially if the right lawyers get involved to prevent competition, especially from powerful companies.When it comes to solving the fundamental problem discussed at the beginning, as well as many symptoms, uploads that voice concern about business or government actions can be submitted to other parties for a formal response once enough users have approved it with their votes. Too often, government and business people have lied and gotten away of it because of the informal way we go about questioning them. With the GDW, something formal will exist and legal actions can more easily be taken. This is a very big advantage for the battle on corruption and negligence!If you are concerned about internal GDW corruption, so I am. There are several design details that address this, such as employees in positions that can be corrupted agreeing to total transparency, and of course lots of monitoring.From innovating the public school curriculum, writing and debating academic articles and books, designing software, finding effective solutions to environmental and social problems, and much more, the GDW could very well provide some of the most significant benefits to innovation ever experienced! As well as to public-government interactions and accountability.To put it simply, the GDW will help us design and protect the future more easily and effectively.Once profitable, 60% of profits will be invested into priority societal development projects, such as those discussed on my website. A key project is innovating the K-12 public school curriculum to teach life skills as a priority. Many know how important this is, but have been unsuccessful in their attempts because of school board negligence and sometimes insufficient funding. With the GDW, we can build and debate a new curriculum together, as well as plan an optimal transition strategy much easier and effectively.Please take some time to reflect on how powerful this concept is. There is an article and a simple prototype tour on my website. https://brr206.wixsite.com/superhumanstrategies/global-debate-websiteBrett’s RoleNow you might be thinking: “How do you plan to do all this Brett A Rogers?”. The answer is simple, I plan to put together a team to do the majority of the work because I am better suited to be a Spokesperson, Visionary, and Author. Very few have had the opportunity to examine, strategize and communicate on the topics of individual and societal development as in depth as I have. It is important for me to keep building on this foundation for best results. As you can imagine, these intentions are time and energy consuming, but also vital for identifying high priority topics concerning the evolution of individuals and society, as well as strategizing and directing associated projects. This is why I need your collaboration and donations. The more time and money I have to develop myself in these ways in collaboration with other noble individuals the better! If I do not get enough financial support, I will have to focus more on making money, which greatly reduces my available time and energy to put team together and move these projects forward.  How I See This UnfoldingAssembling a team for each project, refining the business plans with these teams (I’ve already done a lot of this), incorporating as a Non-Profit, applying for government grants, and putting them into action. Just so you know: I’ve been living frugally for a very long time - Your money will go a long way.I have made a Facebook Page to post monthly and important updates.

Quiggin Report` ,"East York, ON",Other,"Operation: Kill Switch asks why a federally registered taxpayer subsidized charitable organization, with alleged links to extremism, still has charitable status?   Why does the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and many of his caucus members have such strong ties to these types of organizations? Military veteran and intelligence expert, Tom Quiggin, has been sharing technical intelligence analysis on this issue and is now targeted in a frivolous multi-million-dollar lawfare lawsuit to try to silence him. Should taxpayer-funded charities be allowed to target our military veterans with your money? -> Help us protect this military veteran who continues to fight to keep our society (and us) safe from growing extremism.-> Help us expose these organizations and their members for their alleged nefarious connections to extremism by supporting our campaign now.Speak up and act while you still can. Your donations and support will help us fight back.BACKGROUNDLast year, Tom Quiggin, an ex-military intelligence and counter-terrorism expert launched a podcast to share his 30 years of experience in intelligence gathering and analysis on the current threats our society is facing.Tom Quiggin is a court qualified expert on terrorism (criminal court and Federal Court) and “intelligence collection and evidence” (Federal Court). Tom has testified on multiple occasions to Senate and the House of Commons Committees as well as a Royal Commission (Air India Inquiry 2007). He has also provided testimony to the Special Senate Committee on Anti-terrorism (2010).  A former Senior Fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he has 30 plus years of practical intelligence experience in a variety of positions including the: - Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Bank of Canada, - Canadian Armed Forces- United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia- Citizenship and Immigration Canada (War Crimes) - International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (The Hague)- Privy Council Office of Canada. - Arms control inspector for the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the Vienna Document. For the past several years Tom Quiggin has been researching the growth of extremism in western nations engaged in a well financed campaign of entryism, fueled by numerous front groups tracing back to the The Muslim Brotherhood Islamist Terrorist network.  Due to the vast amounts of financial support from foreign actors, mainstream media often refuses to report on these and related topics. They fear reprisal or being targeted by lawfare / harassment lawsuits, designed exclusively to cause ongoing financial damages through exorbitant legal fees charged to any defendant. This is the tactic being used now against Tom Quiggin, Raheel Raza of Muslims Facing Tomorrow, and Tahir Gora (co-authors of the book Submission) for filing an official complaint to Canada’s federal police and intelligence agency, The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Canadian Security and Intelligence Agency (CSIS) is also believe to be surveilling similar operations.  In 2015 a federally registered organization was identified as a Muslim Brotherhood front group in Senate Testimony in Canada. Since then, Tom Quiggin has been exposing the facts of its relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas both listed terrorist organizations by a variety of foreign military and  intelligence agencies. This organization has now launched a retaliatory multi-million dollar lawfare harassment lawsuit accusing Tom Quiggin and six other entities of allegedly running a “campaign of defamation”. Although many of the documents sighted in the RCMP complaint are Government of Canada sources, the organization has decided that these are irrelevant and is desperately trying to keep Tom Quiggin’s body of work on this topic hidden from public consumption.   This is an aggressive scare tactic aiming to force us to abandon our platforms, to censor documented facts and obfuscate the responsibility of the actors involved.We will not back down. They have made this a public legal battle where our irrefutable evidence will expose them to public scrutiny. But we desperately need your support. Operation: Kill Switch is how we do this. We need your help to bring the evidence to trial and take this organization down, so if you support this cause, please help us by contributing to the campaign today.OPERATION: KILL SWITCH The federally registered charity, Islamic Relief Canada, is politically connected to the Liberal Party of Canada, influential in terms of policy and directly linked to Islamic Relief Worldwide. (Islamic Relief Worldwide has been listed as a terrorist funding operation by The United Arab Emirates). Much of our evidence has been provided by government documents and or Islamic Relief Canada’s own documentation, but winning the case and pushing back at this  organizations aggressive bullying tactic, cannot be taken lightly. They have considerable financial resources and support from numerous other powerful organizations. In addition, since the Trudeau government was elected, the organisation in question, are now receiving funding directly from the government of Canada to combat “islamophobia”. This will become relevant at a later date. To document and prove the connections, and to follow the money trail, requires a lot of preparation, an organized and strategic response, and financial resources. This is Operation: Kill Switch - A coordinated effort to defend our rights and freedoms, to question and debate the activities of this group and others like it, and deter them from accessing taxpayer money to finance extremist activities abroad.If you believe in this cause as much as we do, please help us and donate to the campaign now.PREPARATION HAS BEGUNThe victims being targeted in this harassment suit have sought legal council to assess the campaign against them.  Based on initial consultations and research, we have started taking action to prepare our response and a statement of defence - a public document highlighting much of our evidence, which has now been filed with the superior court.  Operation Kill Switch is already very much underway:- A team of researchers with expertise in analysis, from various countries and backgrounds, is collecting more and more evidence- Tom Quiggin is working with other specialists in his network, to build on the evidence in the initial statement of defence and ensure the are filed, and on the public record.- Council retained by Tom Quiggin are experienced in the field of defamation and lawfare suits targeting individuals(What is lawfare? Lawfare is a form of war consisting of the use of the legal system against an enemy, such as by damaging or delegitimizing them, tying up their time or winning a public relations victory. The term is a portmanteau of the words law and warfare.  Lawfare is the use or misuse of the law to silence critics or drive them into submission rather than using other means such as civil discourse or discussion. Islamist groups in North America regularly use well-funded lawfare cases to silence or frighten those who expose their extremist beliefs.)- Community groups and leaders have been contacted to address questions about nefarious entities working within the plaintiff organization, allegedly making statements that could be considered hate speech.  For example, Fathima Bahatta executive member of Islamic Relief has been recorded making statements like “the Jews are the enemies of Islam” and long live the antifada [Holly war against Jews.] We have requested an investigation into hate speech comments demanding her resignation.- Operation Kill Switch will also lead a parallel investigation and inquiry asking how an organization with potentially questionable and/or indirect ties to extremism could still be a federally registered charity under Canadian and international law.- Aid concerned advocacy groups working to fight against extremism, hate speech and groups fighting anti-semitism, to highlight such egregious views and demand the immediate resignation of these individuals. WHO IS INVOLVED?The following people are targeted in the proceedings:TOM QUIGGIN Tom Quiggin is a federal and criminal court-qualified terrorism expert whose expertise on the “the reliability of intelligence as evidence” has been recognized by the Federal and Criminal Court of Canada, where his testimony has been entered as evidence on multiple occasions. Quiggin has conducted ground-breaking work to expose facts that are extremely important not only to Canadians but to the international community, as we deal with a global Islamist insurgency which few people are brave enough to address in public forums for fear of targeting by extremists aligned with the islamist cause. This body of evidence is opening avenues for major discussion and debate desperately needed in our society consumed by political correctness, politicking, and the shameful rise of the muzzling of freedom of speech under the banner of Islamophobia. There are opinions and there are facts; Quiggin does not engage in uninformed speculation. There is at least one group, however, attempting to use a tactic called libel chill, using our very own legal system against us, to silence voices like Tom Quiggin purporting that he has used opinion to run a “campaign of defamation”. Quiggin’s expertise has not gone unnoticed and throughout his career, he has been called upon by numerous government entities and specialist organizations to offer his expert advice to their leaders. Today Tom hosts his own podcast to share his intelligence insight with a wider audience, and has a regular spot on National Post Radio and Sirius XM, in his weekly talk with Anthony Fury, host of Canada Talks (channel 167).  Tom is also a frequent guest on syndicated radio programs such as The Roy Green Show with veteran journalist Roy Green, Charles Adler Tonight, Global News Radio with Award Winning Journalist Alex Pierson, Former political leader turned radio journalist Danielle Smith, and numerous alternative media sources, YouTube Channels, podcasts and other forums. RAHEEL RAZARaheel Raza is a member of the Clarion Project Advisory Board and President of the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow. She is an award-winning journalist, author, public speaker, media consultant, anti-racism activist, and interfaith discussion leader. She is the author of, Their Jihad, Not My Jihad: A Muslim Canadian Woman Speaks Out.A constant presence on television, she has appeared as a regular panellist on Jane Hawtin Live, Michael Coren, Ben Mergui Live, Vision, CBC, CTV, City TV, TVO, Faith Journal and Behind the Line on CTS, OMNI as well as on CBC and CFRB radio. In a presentation to Members of Parliament and international diplomats at the House of Commons in Canada, Raza received a standing ovation for her speech called, “Celebrating our Differences.”Raheel has received many awards for her work building bridges of understanding, including the City of Toronto’s Constance Hamilton award for working towards the equitable treatment of women. She also received the Senate of Canada 150 medal in honour of her advocacy. Senator Frum, speaking at the ceremony, cited Raza’s commitment to liberty and equity and thanked her for “relentless advocacy for human rights, particularly the rights of vulnerable girls and women living under Sharia law”.In June 2006, Raheel was invited to meet Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada following which she also had the honour to meet with Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada. Yet, in subsequent years, Canadian leaders have been less honouring of her accomplishments. While politicians are glad to pose for photo ops with more radical voices, Raza said, “a Muslim woman who has been warning about the dangers of radicalization encroaching on the corridors of every institution in this country is kept away like a pariah.”TAHIR GORAGora is a prominent novelist, poet, journalist, editor, translator and publisher with over 30 years of experience in the industry. Recognized as a bold social activist who has initiated many interfaith and pluralistic streams to bring the Muslim community of Canada together to support progressive ideas and actions.He is a strong proponent of freedom of speech and has developed various initiatives to bring about the much-needed changes in the representational and communal aspects of the Canadian Muslim Community. Gora was active in several literary, cultural and political organizations in Pakistan and was a noted critic of religious intolerance in that country. He is a columnist for the Huffington Post, founder of ‘Canadian Thinkers’ Forum’, ‘Progressive Muslims Institute Canada’ and ‘Muslim Committee Against Antisemitism. He is also a recipient of the Queen Diamond Jubilee Medal for his services in Canada.HELP US FIGHT BACKThe suppression of speech and “m103”, the so-called Islamophobia motion, have already gone too far. We must prevent groups with Islamist ideologies and aspirations antithetical to westphalian liberal democratic values from spreading intolerance into our political systems. Extremist groups or those indirectly supporting extremist activities must be cut off from access to taxpayer funding.Please support Operation: Kill Switch to help put a full-stop on political Islamist entryism.

Jason Chui ,,"Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","Hello World,Have you taken part a protest together with more than ONE MILLION people?And the government simply turn a blind eye on it?For those who are aware of International Headlines, you would know BIG THINGS here are happening in Hong Kong. For a new law that drove more than 1000000 citizens out coming out to protest, there must be something very wrong.“This is the endgame for Hong Kong. It is a matter of life or death. That’s why I come. This is an evil law.”Isn’t Hong Kong just a part of China anyway?Yes, ultimately we belong to China, but we have a different set of laws, currencies, education, language, ID card and passports with China. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region in China. Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997, was handed over to China under the concept of 'one country, two systems,’We the last piece of land that has a fair judicial system, freedom of speech and sound human rights, which are unavailable to our mainland counterparts.After this month, it may all be history already. What happened?On June 9 2019, 1.03 million people marched on Sunday to oppose the government’s controversial extradition bill.  This bill will allow suspects to be transferred to places with which the city does not have an extradition deal, including mainland China.Some facts: 1/ In 2019, China ranked 82nd out of 126 countries on the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index, coming in 12th out of 15 countries in the Asia Pacific. It scored particularly poorly on ""constraints on government power"" and ""fundamental rights"".2/ Two Canadians, Crisis Group director Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, were detained in China last December accused of national security offences.3/ The apparent kidnap of Hong Kong booksellers critical of the mainland government, the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers from office and the jailing of leaders from the Occupy Central movementWhy are we 1000000 citizens coming out and protest?Simply said, the amendments could become a tool to be used against the Chinese Government’s political opponents.Under the proposed law, an extradition request would be reviewed by the courts but it is Hong Kong’s chief executive (Our territory’s leader), who would have the final decision.The Chief Executive, who is not elected but chosen by an election committee accountable to China, would have the authority to decide any request.""The courts will have very little power to reject any extradition request,"" said MK Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.""It's not a formal prosecution so you cannot examine the evidence presented by the other side. We all know that if they want to prosecute someone - a human rights defender or activist - actually in mainland China the charges are political in nature but they use other laws to prosecute them, like tax evasion, for example.""Hong Kong will lose its international reputation as a free society that is different from China. This bill will take away the our to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of association.Police Force as a political weapon?During the protest, police had closed metro stations and funnelled people through narrow thoroughfares, prompting accusations that they were deliberately attempting to reduce the scale of the protest.At night, the scenes were reminiscent of 2014 when police used tear gas to disperse pro-democracy demonstrators outside the same building, sparking public anger and setting off two months of demonstrations that took over key intersections.Armed police + unarmed young citizens = International reactions?The proposal has been met with concern by several countries.A US congressional commission said in May the proposed changes would make Hong Kong more susceptible to China's ""political coercion"" and further erode Hong Kong's autonomy.Britain and Canada expressed similar views in a joint statement, adding they were concerned over the ""potential effect"" that the proposed changes would have on UK and Canadian citizens in Hong Kong.The European Union has also issued a diplomatic note to Mrs Lam expressing concerns over the proposed changes to the law.China's foreign ministry has refuted such views, calling them attempts to ""politicise"" the Hong Kong government proposal and interference in China's internal affairs.Hong Kong Government reaction?A FEW HOURS AFTER THE PROTEST, the Hong Kong government has made clear its controversial extradition bill will go forward. IMAGINE  1 MILLION POEPLE IN YOUR CITY COME OUT, AND THE GOV JUST TURN A BLIND EYE!!The extradition bill is due to have its Second Reading on Wednesday June 12 2019, where Legislative Council Members (i.e. our version of Senators in Parliament) will debate and vote.Facts:1/The Pro-Govt political parties has out-numbered the votes of the People-elected democratic parties. Basically, the council is dysfunctional in a sense and many bad/ debatable laws were passed in similar manner. 2/What’s worse, some of the Pro-Democracy camp legislators were disqualified and “being resigned” last year by the government (e.g. Because of reading The Inauguration Oath too slowly)The result is obvious. And when a bill has been given three readings, it becomes an Ordinance enacted by the Legislative Council.And there, farewell to Hong Kong.THE ONLY OPTION:We will stay and protest around the Legislative Council in Wednesday June 12 2019, when they have the Second Reading.Many of the kind employers has shown compassion for employees to take leave on that day.However, most of the supportive citizens will still have to work on the day, making the event much smaller scale than last time for certain.While we will not will not engage in any illegal or violent activities, we are posting  on behalf of our fellow young people and students:We care. We have the time and heart.We are not afraid of danger and power.We do not have a lot of burden.But also we do not have enough resources. The funds raised will be used to purchase supplies; e.g. water, food, medicines etc.Potentially, depend on the sum, anonymous donations will be made to the organizer. Potentially, depend on the sum, for bailing out activists who were detained by local authorities.Potentially, depend on the sum, you can be an important force to change history.Honestly, we don’t know whether we can make true impact to the outcome of this bill.  We have no choice, and we must go out to try the best we can.The last time we unite was at 2003, when Article 23 (Similar to this new bill) was going to enact. But 500000 people came out and stopped it! This time with 10000000, there are hopes.Eggs are so little against the solid wall. But we hope that, if we raise enough awareness around the globe, perhaps the outcome will be different before the Third Reading.Who knows what will happen?Will you stand on the side of the egg? ","June 11, 2019",0,"$300,000 goal"
Rickey Morris ,"Houston, TX",Community & Neighbors,"Hello my fellow Americans, First giving honor to God, an alpha Big Mama, my loving Mother, sisters, brothers, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins and my awesome spiritual family members I love you all and thanks for your support. Please allow me reintroduce myself. I am your 2020 Libertarian Presidential Candidate. Sen/Rep_ArkLaTex, USA-Rickey Dean  Morris Jr. Year . With being born in LSU hospital in Shreveport, LA, raised in Houston with my grandparents for most of my 39 years of life to understanding the complex need of solid healthcare insurance after assisting my granddad for 18 years. Yes I agree the current system must be overhauled completely for a solid healthcare for all plan that expands our current Medicare and Medicaid programs, a more profitable economy for all employees, a secure and sustainable future through education for all no matter your back ground start in life, beliefs, color, or ethnic culture. We can't keep recycling and repeating a top elitist practice that talks about serving all when the minority and underprivileged of all ethnicities are suffering to earn a decent wage for their families only to have tax money we all rely on stolen from them then, asked for more by the same two party system that leaves out the mass population of Americans. Fake regulations and laws that apply to the masses as a break the weak into submission practice is obsolete, and long over due for a Libertarian President named Rickey D Morris Jr to serve all Americans not just the elite. Though I will be open to support my go fund me page will serve as a promotional tool only, just like when I ran for US Senate Libertarian Party for the state of Texas I will run for President not King of America. With my own personal finances that I work for as Security Specialist and the power of God=Jesus Sr and Jr. Either the voting system will become honest or we the people will create a new one together- separate from the the Slavery system known as the Democratic/Republican Party=Bipartisan. Under Libertarian Presidential Leadership We will become a free and United America that serves it's young and old of all backgrounds and ethnicities for the better. Not just serve us tickets make non violent offenders hardened criminals, then kill our own citizens with autocracy, and mob like principals for speaking out against the wrongs that we so rudely turn blind eyes and deaf ears to in jail and on our city streets. I almost can believe that past and present leadership will live up to the words we voted all in by but a popularity contest has continued to leave out God and the citizens of America as it's focus. Canada, The United States, and. Mexico make up North America, then we have Central and South America but they are all America so we must foster better relationships with our close and distant family neighbors  that have been so economically damaged by the current administration. Not only was I at the tale end of Bushes' administration creating Homeland Security after 9/11. I was there helping pass legislation during Obama and Trumps administration. Now non of them know me personally but if you have heard of the T.W.I.C. Card I.D. All three Presidents and Homeland Security as we know it are currently going by the rules I tested after being adopted by Coast Guard, Customs, Port Police, and ICE.  It was developed by the Commissioner then given to me to beta test by the previous FOS and DOS to the Port of Houston.  After being adopted by the Queen of England herself and placed to govern Maritime Law, all waterway and airports are now governed by the T.W.I.C. Card. Just by adding the card we added 3 million American and 6 million globally that others manipulate just for credit. We must change now for a better today and tomorrow. So lets mobilize, donate, volunteer and treat each other as one spirit family from God, physically from Adam and Eve we are all partakers in the Human experience to help our fellow man so now its time to help ourselves as well. So send me to Washington DC to work and fight for you the way I always have. Working with allies on both sides during 4 different administrations we have passed 10 of 12 proposed laws for the betterment of all humanity now lets stay the course.

Connor Sellars ,"Brampton, ON",Volunteer & Service,"Dear Fellow Members of the VRA Association of Canada. This Go Fund Me Page has been activated to assist with legal fees incurred by the members of the “New Board” Elected at the June 1st, 2016 AGM held in Alberta.As many of you know since that time the “New Board” and “Old Board” have been negotiating with legal assistance to resolve many of the discrepancies between the two boards and to move forward with a new AGM to be held in Toronto.This campaign has been organized as many members have communicated their support to the “New Board” to assist with payment of their legal fees so that this democratic process can occur on the 29th of October.If you are interested in assisting with this campaign, please donate via our Go Fund Me Page.Any and all monies collected will go towards the “New Board” legal fees and if they are not used, the money will be put back into the association for the members.Thank you for your support.Below for your review is an update of all activities and progress made to date between the two boards.VRA Update:As many of you are aware, early this year many of our VRA members began expressing concerns over the future of VRA as well as the actions of some members. Member’s questions and concerns were not being adequately addressed. You are all aware now of the events surrounding the VRA AGM of 2016 and the subsequent differing opinions on who was in fact the VRA BOD. The “Old Board” and the “New Board” have been working with legal counsel to determine a way and course of action to rectify these issues. Although this has been a long and arduous process I am pleased to say that we have received many concessions to our requests and a course of action to move forward appears to be shaping up. We all agree that as a membership society the final say lies with members. As such, we agree that a new AGM be set and at that time the membership can vote on individual directors for each eligible position. Historically, the membership was provided with only a slate to be voted on. This slate was at the sole discretion of the nominations committee. The “New Board” does not believe this to be a fair process. The following items have been proposed:1.  Call for Nominations: A call for nominations for all positions with the exception of the Society representatives will go out to members 30 days prior to the AGM. All nominations that meet the requirements as set out in the by-laws will be considered by the nominations committee. All nominations that meet the requirements will be presented to the membership for voting. Therefore, each director position will need to be voted on rather than one slate.2. Agenda for the AGM:  The agenda for the AGM will be provided one week in advance of the AGM date. Resolutions to be considered by the members at the AGM will be circulated to all members prior to the meeting with the agenda.3. The AGM Date will be changed:  The AGM date we propose is October 29th, 2016.4. Legal Counsel Present at the AGM:  Both factions can have legal counsel present at the AGM; either in person or via video conference or teleconference.5.  Join Communications:  A neutral joint communication will go out to all members.  The point of the joint communications should be to inform the membership of what is going on and why without any value judgment or opinion about which position on the issues is correct or not.6. Membership List:  A membership list must be provided two weeks prior to the AGM. The purpose is to ensure that all members who have a right to vote are counted.7.  Numbers of director seats for election:  12 director seats.8.  Nomination Committee:  The nominations committee with consist of an individual from each faction and a third party to be agreed upon by both.9.  AGM election scrutineers:   Each faction will appoint two scrutineers. The factions need to identify their appointed representative to act as scrutineers during the AGM as soon as possible.10. Electronic Participation in AGM:  Electronic participation will be permitted11. Ballot Voting: Ballot voting will be done for in person voting12. Proxy Voting: Those members attending via webinar will vote electronically and all voting by members physically present at the meeting or represented by proxy physically present at the meeting will proceed by way of ballot.  All members will receive a proxy form and will be reminded of their right to vote by proxy.  All executed proxy forms will be required to be returned to Kreston GTA, who will be the third party managing the voting by members physically present in person or by proxy at the AGM.Those individuals, who are appointed proxy, will have the opportunity to pick up the relevant proxy forms at the meeting and drop the attached ballots, as directed in the proxy, in the relevant ballot boxes.Help spread the word!","September 15, 2016","$6,150","$40,000 "
Ben Done ,"Sudbury, ON",Education & Learning,"I met Gracia a short time ago when he was given shelter by my residence at Huntington University. He was very friendly to me, polite, and happy to be moving into our building. What I found out later is that Gracia hadn't had a roof over his head since April of 2016. Before moving to Canada in 2007, 28-year-old Gracia lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Africa. Upon moving here, he had a place to stay, but unfortunately it fell though. But that didn't stop Gracia, and he has continued to study Liberal Science at Laurentian University, despite having no place to call home in this cold northern city. From the moment I met Gracia, I could tell that he was an outstanding young man who does not consider himself a victim of his circumstances. He believes that each hardship, even something like a common cold, is a challenge for him to overcome - something to remind him that he has the strength to succeed in this world. In just two days of living in Huntington, he demonstrated his community-minded kindness by cleaning all of the dirty dishes in our community kitchen, which is shared by almost forty students. This is a man that no matter how little he has, is always looking to help others in whatever way he can.With their own situations to deal with, Gracia has no family to turn to here in Sudbury. Thanks to the LAMPS (Laurentian Association of Mature and Part-time Students), he has found his way into my residence and into the arms of a new community that wants to make him part of our family. Asking for little, Gracia has been incredibly grateful for the help he has received so far.  In the spirit of the holidays, I ask that we come together to help this young man get on his feet, because I know that once he does, he will pay it back to the world tenfold. The money raised  will be used to make sure that Gracia has shelter, food, clothes, school supplies, and help him finish his degree so that he can guarantee a better future for himself.Once the funds have been delivered into my account I will withdraw the amount necessary to pay for Gracia's residence for the remainder of the year. I will set up a meeting with the Huntington Residence Accounting office to do that. Gracia and I will work together to decide how much of the remaining funds will go towards his tuition and how much he will need for food and other essentials. Let's make this a Christmas that Gracia will never forget! ￼","December 6, 2017","$5,775","$15,000 "
Evan Rogers ,"Victoria, BC",Other,"Hello, My name is Evan Rogers, I am 29 years old, and currently living in Victoria, British Columbia—and I would like to share my story.I have been a practicing kinesiologist for a little over two years at Shelbourne Physiotherapy and for as long as I can remember, I have dreamt of becoming a doctor. Three years ago, I began the application process for medical school. First, I applied to the University of Alberta (where I did my BSc in Kinesiology)—rejection. Second, I applied in my home province to UBC medicine and was rejected again with a low academic score. I enrolled in a third-year Biochemistry course at the University of Victoria to boost my GPA, and scored an A+, and then applied to UBC again, as well as Memorial University in Newfoundland—and read once more, “We regret to inform you…” Finally, fate intervened, and I took on a new patient: a retired General Surgeon in Victoria, who was involved in training resident surgeons from UBC. He took it upon himself, along with another colleague, an MD graduate from UCC in Ireland, now GP in Victoria, to mentor me. I felt honoured that despite the arduous application process, people of medical merit believed in me. With their help, and the support of the many other wonderful people in my life including my parents and partner, April, my fourth application to Atlantic Bridge, an application service for seven Irish Medical Schools, was accepted. I was invited to travel to Toronto with two weeks notice for an interview. Something to note is that Ireland has a similar population to British Columbia, yet they have seven medical schools to our one. Every year, the school admits one hundred and thirty applicants, and forty-five of those spots are given to International students. Forty of those forty-five students are typically Canadian. The interview was held two weeks later in Toronto. I was so nervous that I spent the week going to sleep at 9pm to adjust for the time change and an 8:00 am interview. In the interview, I sat across from two professors for 20 minutes and attempted to answer their questions to the best of my ability. Three days later, I received a call. I was accepted! I felt a surge of self-worth and excitement. My drive had paid off; I deserved this. I was, and am, so grateful for the opportunity to pursue my dream. I'm aware that not everyone gets this. Though, the reality is, tuition per year is 41,000 EUR, which runs just over 60,000 CAD, and the program is 4 years long. This will total well over 200,000 CAD before I can return to Canada to complete my residency. As supportive as my family and partner are, my parents are retired and April and I simply do not have the money. However, before I can ask for help, I believe it only fair for you to understand my current practice in kinesiology and use it as a window into the type of doctor I hope to become. The part of this job which I enjoy the most is connecting with my clients and helping them overcome their problems; whether it be a recent surgery, osteoarthritis, whiplash, concussion, depression, obesity, fibromyalgia, or any particular ailment, each initial assessment provides a unique challenge. Though my current scope is limited to active rehabilitation, I always try to provide complete care by exploring all relevant aspects of their lifestyle. Asking the right questions and really connecting with a patient can lead to an educated referral, encouragement to seek additional treatment, and empowerment to make the most of what they have. My practice as a Kinesiologist has grown quite large, with a 2-3 week wait-list This is particularly of note when considering that kinesiology is not covered in our public health care system. Aside from motor vehicle accident injury claims covered through car insurance (ICBC), everyone I see pays out of pocket. I should also mention sport as a major influence on my growth and maturation throughout high school and Universty. Many pounds heavier, I played linebacker for the University of Alberta Golden Bears for six years. At the time, it was the most important thing in the world to me. I absolutely loved it. Though my grades suffered from my commitment to sport, it taught me the level of drive and commitment required to be part of something great—and it is one of the main reasons why I had to apply to an overseas medical program. With the current shortage of Canadian Medical Schools, hopes of getting in without a near perfect GPA are about as slim as Trump rallying for democratic socialism. Additionally, after having four surgeries from various sports injuries, I am no stranger to the mental and physical processes of rehabilitation. This has paid dividends in my ability to connect with rehab clients which i plan to continue into my career in medicine. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story. Regardless of your support, be it financial or in your thoughts, I am grateful. Please know that any amount is a huge help and your support is greatly appreciated.I will update with progress as much as I can, and if you would like to know more about either the University of Limerick  or Altantic Bridge , feel free to click the links!","June 4, 2016","$10,800","$200,000 "
Danny Sass ,"Washington, DC",Education & Learning,"
When I first met Glory Aganze in 2011, he was a shy soon-to-be 9th grader who who was still struggling to find his voice and adjust to life in the United States. He soon managed to carve out a community for himself on the soccer field, and he quickly established himself as one of the highest fliers in Digital Harbor's ESOL program.I didn't know it at the time, but Glory's initial success proved to be a harbinger of things to come. Over the next seven years, Glory continued to grow in ways that I (and probably he) never could have imagined. He became a starting defender and eventually a starting goalkeeper on the Varsity soccer team. He wrote and eventually shared his migration narrative with diverse arrays of educators, philanthropists, and change-agents in Baltimore City. He accelerated through his high school ESOL curriculum, eventually exiting ESOL and earning placement in both AP English Language and Composition and AP English Literature and Composition. This success manifested itself in other ways too. Glory became involved in BICO (Baltimore Inner City Outings) and earned his SCUBA certification. He began volunteering and working with elementary and middle school students as part of the Digital Harbor Foundation's Technology Center, and he would often work with other refugee and immigrant students as a coach and mentor through his participation in Soccer Without Borders.Glory's academic, athletic, and extracurricular successes ultimately led him to the University of Maryland as a recipient of the prestigious Incentive Award, a full tuition scholarship awarded to top students in Baltimore City, Prince George's County, and DCPS. Glory arrived on campus in College Park eager to make an immediate impact, but he was far from his family. His mother moved from Baltimore to Iowa City, and  his older brother was finishing college in Pennsylvania. He sought to build a new ""family"" at UMD. He studied business and organizational management, joined the club soccer team and a Christian students group, and worked an on-campus job. He even volunteered to speak with and mentor immigrant and refugee students at my new school, the International High School at Langley Park. Glory's mother recently fell ill in Iowa, and Glory took a leave of absence from his studies in order to care for her. He did so without formally withdrawing for the semester, as he thought he could juggle his familiar responsibilities with his academic ones. Unfortunately, his GPA dropped below the threshold needed to maintain his scholarship, and Glory now finds himself in a bit of a bind. He will ultimately transfer schools to be closer to his family in Iowa, but in the meantime, he is hoping to bolster his resume with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. After leaving his home in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Glory lived for three years in Uganda before ultimately receiving a refugee visa to come to the United States. He was recently offered a position that would enable him to return to Uganda for six months to serve as a coach, mentor, and teacher to refugee youth in Kampala through Soccer Without Borders - Uganda (see more here!) This, of course, comes with some challenges. These include:

- Flights. Glory will need to pay for his roundtrip ticket to Uganda. We hope to raise $2000 to pay for a round trip flight from Canada to Uganda.

- Living expenses. We hope to raise ~$3000 to cover living expenses, meals, transport, and other miscellaneous costs (health care, etc.) on the ground in Kampala.For all of you who know Glory and the tremendous impact he has had on all of us who have worked with him, please share this far and wide within your networks. He truly is an amazing young man, and I am excited by the prospect of him having this opportunity and getting himself back on track to earn his college degree!Please don't hesitate to email me if you have additional questions!

Ariel Mishkin ,"Vancouver, BC",Volunteer & Service,"Leaders from around the world are meeting in New York at the United Nations Headquarters once again to discuss the impact of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action this March. I feel compelled to participate despite self-funding my travel, accommodation, and food costs since our generation is witnessing the disintegration of reproductive rights around the globe and backlash against simple feminist principles. Last year, I gave up my government job to advocate for gender equality. I currently volunteer in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) with a feminist organization and support climate justice for ethnic minority women in the region. As you can imagine, it pays the bills but just barely.  As a part of this work, I prioritized Lao civil society presence at this global meeting and I managed to secure funding for two local activists to attend! Due to this prioritization, I am self-funding my own attendance in order to provide support. In addition, I will be a part of a self-funded Canadian Civil Society delegation that will be demanding stronger commitments from the Canadian government. In particular, I will be advocating for reconciliation and stronger action to stop the genocide Canada is committing against Indigenous Women and Girls.I'm a young person flying by the seat of my pants to attend this forum. It would be greatly appreciated if you could donate anything. Every few dollars will count towards a greasy slice of pizza or a cup of coffee while I am in the Big Apple. I plan on couch surfing and sharing a one-bedroom apartment with my colleagues for two weeks, but my personal financial resources are just not cutting it. It would mean the world to me to know that people in my life also care about gender equality. I sincerely appreciate your help and hope that I can represent Canadian civil society well.","February 5, 2020",$530,$350 
Allen Tang ,"Malden, MA",Travel & Adventure,"Hello there! I'm creating this campaign for my travelling friend, Liduo Mo:------Hello!  My name is Liduo from China. I am a backpacker traveling going around the world.  So what has been changed in my life that I decided to get far away from my homeland and to become a traveler all over planet earth?    Flashback two years to when I was merely a normal office worker in Shenzhen.  Then I got shocked by the sad news that my mother is facing the last moment of her life because of cancer.   I quit my job and ran back to my hometown.  Four months later, she went to heaven. Since she was suffering from cancer for 17 years, what she could leave for me was only the house where me and my mom had been living for 12 years.     However, my family on my mom’s side wanted to take away part of my mom’s heritage forcing me to have to dispute with my aunt regarding the house.   That began a long journey fighting for the house.  I was heavily impacted and it was so hard to accept the fact that the one who loved me the most, who influenced me the most, who was the most significant person in my life, had passed away. I would never ever have thought that when I was so depressed and hopeless, that my family would not care about me but about the money.      The struggle lasted six months, after which what was left of my mother’s estate was processed into my name except for my mother’s house.  To settle things I had to give part of the house to my aunt as well as some of the money inheritance.  One of the reasons was to show appreciation for their help in taking care of my mother during the time I was absent for work away from home.  The other reason was I did not want to be stuck too long at my hometown disputing things with my family.  What’s more I could not handle the serious mental problems I realized I was facing and which nearly took my life.    This is the situation in which I realized I NEEDED A NEW LIFE!        So my new life started with I thought at first would be a working holiday in Australia.  During the next year I came to live a completely different life from China.  From a conventional ‘normal’ girl I became quite transformed.  I cut and dyed my hair.  I tried new adventures such as Skydiving, Scuba diving, Bunjee Jumping, unusual road trips. I worked quite crazily hard, and I played crazily hard.   I became always the one speaking out for myself and other working holidays workers when the employer treated us badly.  I became the one brave enough to break the rules.     As I realized I was absolutely enjoying my new life I also realized how important it is to live for myself and experience life in new and different ways all the time.  I realized that now my soul was free for the first time, unrestricted and unconventional life can be so exhilarating and rewarding.    I also took the life decision to become a Christian. I accepted Jesus Christ at a baptize church in Cairns after 8 years of cautious consideration. I know in my heart that it is God’s plan in this way to have me as his child.  I feel I am always being loved by Jesus and also by my Christian family in Australia. I am no longer lonely as I know wherever I go there is always the Christian family for me all over the world.  Now I can truly appreciate everything in the world.  The fresh air is free, the warm sun is free, the love is powerful and infinite, just like Jesus's love. My life has been transformed because of Jesus Christ.    After spending that one amazing year on what I still think of as a working holiday in Australia, my curiosity now drives me to explore more and more about the world.  So now I am fulfilling my next plan which was at first to travel to South America and now North America.  I have already traveled to Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, and now I am traveling around the Unites States with Canada ahead.     I have seen so many beautiful national parks and landscapes, including Torres De Pain Park, Atacama Desert in Chile, Fitz Roy and Perito Moreno Glacier in Chile, the end of the world lighthouse, Iguazu Waterfalls in Argentina, Yellowstone and Grand Canyon National Parks in America, Uyuni Salt Flat and Skymirro in Bolivia.        I have learned so much from historical places, such as Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, the greatest National museums in Washington DC, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis island in New York.      I have learned so much about people and culture from couchsurfing with local and meeting so many wonderful people on my roadtrips and travels.  The cool start-up business man Amr from Egypt in Santiago whom I stayed with, a lovely family from Paraguay invited me as their guest at Bueno Aries, the Christian friends that I have received so much love from.     I had such amazing travel experiences accompanied by a Cantonese girl Cherry with whom I did a lot hitchhiking together.  Then there is my cool best friend Allen who I made 9000 mile month-long road trip.  And ten there is my mentor life coach Mark who is such an incredible international journalist whom I stayed with in Washington DC.       All these amazing places, experiences, and people now further inspire me and drive me to explore more and more, to challenge myself with more experiences and adventures     I am deeply touched by how beautiful the world is, and now I know that I want so much to contribute to that world all around me.  I really appreciate my mom even more now as without her I would not have been able to step away from the normal, conventional life I use to live.  But even so sometimes I am saddened by the ways I have been pushed away from China.      I am not sure whether it is the realities of China or the traditional superstitious background where I am from, but for now I realize I cannot go back to China.  I want to continue my travels throughout North American, then Latin America, and then to continue on to Africa, Europe, the Middle East and maybe Antartica.      I want to finish my first around world trip in in the next three years. I know this will in some ways be tough especially as I have limited financial means.    In my current situation I have three things on my shoulders for which I have to come up with funds.  1) Travel funds for myself.  2)  Funds for my aunt’s treatment as she got lung cancer one year ago.  3)  Money for going to Business School to get an MBA degree which I would like to start next year.     So for these reasons I will need your kind help for my travel funds, this funds would be used on my travel only, including transportation such as airplane, train, bus; accormodation, food, tours and so on. As I am on my travel at the moment, I would appreciated if I get support from you all. In return, I will contribute myself into various volunteer program and share travel tips in different channels, also I will share what I have been doing back in China and in my hometown. I was planning to share my experiences and ideas about traveling overseas because I want to help people get rid of the limited dark cave that I once now feel I was living in.  I really want to encourage people living in China see the world through my new eyes not through Chinese VPN. I want to tell them about the world of democratic ideas and liberty outside of China.  I want to inspire people everywhere with the realization I now have that travel around the world is really possible and can be so exhilarating.      When my travel end,  if my travel fund there is money left, I will donate to charity or return to Gofundme platform to help anyone in need.

We are the only English-language Marxist cultural website and publication dedicated to all highlighting, promoting and making accessible all aspects of creative culture–art, music, film, poetry, fiction, dance, etc. We believe that art and creativity aren’t just side issues to the fight for a radically different future, but rather, integral to it. In fact, we believe that the ability of ordinary people to imagine something different is essential to advancing our vision of a socialist society, and we seek to highlight art and analysis that help feed this radical imagination. In a similar vein, Historical Materialism is a Marxist journal based in London which holds annual conferences all over the world from Australia and Lebanon to Canada and New York City, and its flagship conference in London. Over the last nineteen years, Historical Materialism has become a key place for socialist and radical thinkers to discuss the heady ideas related to a total transformation of society in a fresh light. This is done in the spirit of asking what works and what doesn’t in order to rebuild a vibrant, thinking socialist movement.So what can Red Wedge bring to Historical Materialism this year?We believe the weakness of contemporary cultural production is connected to a mutually reinforcing dyad of cultural disbelief in an alternative to capitalism (i.e. “There Is No Alternative”) and the real-world defeats of the past few decades. The imaginative center of the socialist brain has been deprived of oxygen and we see ourselves among the caretakers of a kernel of something different that can help get it breathing once again. We want to debate with and learn from other cultural Marxists and do our modest part in enlarging and enabling a new popular avant-garde that can engage the intellectual and real-world ruins that surround us.Historical Materialism brings out academics, yes, but more importantly it brings out people – both in academia and outside of it – looking to better understand capitalism’s strengths and weaknesses in order to take what we learn back to our workplaces and campuses and other sites of struggle to reinvigorate and advance are revolutionary work. And some things like meaningful discussion and debate just have to be done in real life which is why we have organized a panel entitled “Reclaiming the Popular Avant-Garde” which will see 3 of our editors presenting the following papers:· “For a 21st Century Avant-Garde” by Alexander Billet· “The Democratic Image: Aesthetic Leveling and Differentiated Totality” by Adam Turl· “The Thirst is Real: On Drinking the Lemonade and Bringing Back the Popular  Avant-Garde” by Crystal Stella Becerril.As we mentioned above, we, the dedicated editorial team behind Red Wedge magazine, are struggling members of the destitute working-class in the U.S. trying to make a living while at the same time working to advance discourse around art and revolutionary politics. We are adjuncts and service workers; manual laborers and freelancers; working artists and revolutionaries and we desperately need your help getting out to London. If it is within your financial means to donate (any amount, however small, helps!) to our travel fund, please consider doing so. If it is not, we'd sincerely appreciate it if you took the time to share our GoFundMe page with your social, familial and where appropriate, your professional networks.We'd like to extend a sincere thank you for all of the support you have given us over the years.

Seamus Berkeley ,"Taos, NM",Volunteer & Service,"Bernie Sanders speaks directly to the current concerns of not only our nation, but all nations and offers remedies on how we can, together, return to a socially responsible America that benefits every person and the planet.  I was born in Ireland. My family emigrated first to Canada then, when I was seven, to the United States. My parents became US citizens within a few years and I was naturalized along with them. The process was straightforward and the country, at that time, welcomed new citizens.We lived in Massachusetts where my father worked as a machinist for the camera company Polaroid and my mother worked as a homemaker and retail sales person. These were prosperous times when middle class families could own a home and thrive on an average income. For me, going to college was affordable: it was possible to attend school full time, work a part time job, live with other students off-campus and still graduate without student debt nor family support.These opportunities are no longer available to most Americans, especially young people who likely do not know what conditions used to be and could possibly be again. Rather, most of us have become accustomed to living with burdensome debt, high rents and stagnant wages. We can do better. We deserve better.As a pledged Delegate for Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelpia, I will do my absolute best to make sure Bernie Sanders is our next president by supporting the views he represents for the well-being of us all.Thanks for your support!Bonus: Planning to broadcast live from the convention!

These groups attack Canadians during peaceful assembly and on social media in order to change the Narrative and disrupt these events and have free speech shut down.We believe that it is time for Canadians to be heard in a Different way, one that involves Signatories getting behind a successful Campaign to Have Trudeau held to an account of Treason, not to mention a Bevy of other actions that can be validated Easily with even just Common public Knowledge of the multiple actions of Trudeau and his unruly Cabinet.CANADA, IT IS TIME FOR US TO ACT.

Gary McHale ,"Binbrook, ON",Other,"McHale Appeals to have Justin Trudeau Criminally ChargedSeeking $25,000McHale Fights for the Rights of all Citizens to Ensure the Crown cannot Pre-screen Private Prosecution Charges.McHale’s rulings both in Superior Court and at the Court of Appeal already set the standard for how private citizens can file criminal charges against government officials. McHale has been very successful at getting various police officers criminally charged including:OPP Commissioner Julian Fantino for threatening municipal officials;OPP Deputy Commissioner Chris Lewis on obstructing justice;OPP Superintendent Ron Gentle on obstructing justice;Various OPP officers for mischief for aiding protesters to build barricades. Trudeau Obstructed Justice and RCMP failed to take Action:For the past 8 months the public has seen how Justin Trudeau obstructed the Attorney General of Canada (Jody Wilson-Raybould) by attempting to stop the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.The Rich Protect the RichYou can be assured that if you or I committed this offense the police would be banging on our door to arrest us. Private prosecution gives every citizen the right to bring criminal charges before an independent justice for review in order to have charges issued.On Nov. 4, 2019 McHale appeared in criminal court in Ottawa to present the evidence of Trudeau’s crime but the Crown quickly stayed the case before the Justice of the Peace could even hear the evidence. The Crown, in effect, is ensuring that citizens cannot hold government officials accountable.Strong Case to Appeal:McHale will be filing a judicial review in Superior Court of the Crown’s actions and if he wins you can be assured that the Crown will appeal the win to the Court of Appeal. Funds are needed to enable that resources are available to finish the battle to protect the rights of all citizens and also to make sure that Justin Trudeau is held accountable for his illegal actions.The funds will be managed by McHale and will be used to cover all legal expenses including a lawyer, transcripts, filing material and McHale’s time to dedicate the hundreds of hours needed to do a proper Notice of Judicial Review, a Factum, a Book of Authorities and then to review and respond to any material filed by the Crown. Funds are also needed to cover all expenses to attend court in Ottawa.See Link to Notice of Judicial Review The Crown has demonstrated its willingness to function outside the law by doing pre-charge screenings and by seeking the evidence so the Crown can review it before the Justice sees the evidence. The Crown is subverting the will of Parliament which has clearly provided in law that the Crown is to hear the evidence at the same time the Justice hears the evidence – i.e. in a court room during a pre-enquete which is an in-camera hearing.A Win would Protect the Rights of All Citizens:A win would strengthen the rights of all citizens to hold government officials accountable. A win would force the courts to review the evidence against Justin Trudeau which would almost guarantee he would be charged with obstructing justice.No one is above the law and the RCMP have failed to hold Trudeau accountable. The Crown has stepped in to ensure Trudeau isn’t charged.This must STOP and McHale’s Appeal can accomplish this.Please Support this Battle!The Legal Team:Gary McHale is not a lawyer or para-legal but has already won at the Court of Appeal more than once and his rulings on Private Prosecution are now binding on courts throughout Canada. McHale has successfully arrested uniformed police officers and successfully issued criminal charges against the highest-ranking officers in Ontario.McHale’s associate Randy Fleming recently won at the Supreme Court of Canada regarding how police target peaceful protesters at public events instead of arresting violent protesters who show up for the purpose of harassing and threatening average citizens who want to exercise their free speech rights in Canada. Link to Story Lawyer Daniel Ciarabellini has joined the team to help with any legal applications in Superior Court or at the Court of Appeal. While Ciarabellini has only been a lawyer for a short period of time, he has already established his passion to help average citizens by winning, as a law student, a case against a former homeless person who had over $65,000 in fines that had accumulated over the years.

With nothing but each other we started a new journey and ended up in Lebanon where we stayed in a refugee camp for three years. We spent many nights trying to stay warm and dreaming of a brighter future.Eventually we moved to a small town in Canada, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, where we now call home. The people here have welcome us warmly and have helped us in many ways.   We make chocolate again. In late September 2016 we received international recognition for our little business when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told our story in an address to the United Nations.

Our business is on the cusp of success but we do not have the processes and infrastructure in place to meet the demand.We’re are starting a 30 day campaign and asking for your support. Your generous donations will allow us to:  1) Get our chocolate on store shelves by conducting the detailed and important Product/Consumer Testing & Certifications big stores require. 2) Expand, create new jobs and sharing our chocolate with the world. That means we need a bigger factory (our current one is a tiny 100 square feet!).  3) Tell our Canadian Syrian Refugee story  – When much of the world closed its doors to us Canada welcomed our family (and 25 000 Syrians) with open arms. We want to ensure our story stands for generations and so we will build into our new factory a record of what happened to us and how Canada changed our lives forever.  Thank you for taking the time to read our story.

Ashley Fairgrieve-McInnis ,"Orillia, ON","Medical, Illness & Healing","Aunika Rowan Kerr (the ARK) was born September 23, beautiful and strong, but with a variety of health challenges. These health challenges came as a surprise to her parents Jason and Maggie, as there had been no issues with the pregnancy and no indication that anything was wrong. Unfortunately shortly after she was delivered, Aunika had severe breathing and feeding issues resulting in her being transferred to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Throughout her short life Dr's have discovered, Auni has zero T-cells, and therefore no functioning immune system. To date, all testing for genetic issues have come back negative, and Dr's are left at a stand still questioning why she is missing her T-cells. Every day that passes she is more at risk. Time unfortunately is not on her side. Treatment options that have been suggested are for her to undergo a bone marrow transplant (@ Sick Kids Hospital, Toronto), and/or a thymus gland transplant (@ Duke University, North Carolina) which could cost up to $100,000 for testing and. To help decide on the best option for Aunika, they need a 'Whole Exome Sequence' of genetic testing to be completed at the Genedx genetic testing facility in Maryland. The cost of the test is $9000 USD. Currently the. Timeline given for testing is 5 months. This is far too long, because every day, Aunika is at risk. The Ontario government requires parents to wait up to 8 weeks to complete an application through OHIP, followed by another 2-3 months for testing to be completed. We must raise awareness at the highest level to help speed this process up in any way we can for Aunika. Aunika's blood has also been submitted for testing, in search of a suitable bone marrow donor. If you are interested in becoming a bone marrow donor in Canada, visit www.onematch.ca for more information. Because her body does not have the ability to fight any infection if she contracts one, thus impacting her ability to survive, Aunika is being kept in isolation at her family's home.

Liisa Tikkala ,"Dunchurch, ON","Sports, Teams & Clubs","GIVE BACK TO AK-O-MAK! Help Camp Ak-O-Mak raise funds for a much-needed pavilion. THE CAUSEMy name is Liisa Tikkala, and I am raising funds and awareness to support one of the most beloved camps in the world, Camp Ak-O-Mak. Camp Ak-O-Mak in northern Ontario, Canada was the world’s first ever swimming and sports camp just for girls, and it continues to be a revolutionary place that provides extraordinary outdoor experiences for an unstoppable future generation of women leaders. Many of the good parts of who I’ve become are the result of the people I spent time with and admired at this camp. At Ak-O-Mak, I was a camper, counselor, coach, and director. But I only became the leader I was because of the remarkable role models that believed in me over the years. It was an absolutely transformative experience at a critical time in my life when I was understanding my own self-worth. All the wins and losses of my life since then I have met with a fortitude that was finely tuned at Ak-O-Mak. And now Camp Ak-O-Mak needs help. It’s time for us to give back. Something this camp has never had is a multi-purpose building to run rainy day activities and dry-land programs during the summer and store specialized sports equipment during the winter. Presently there is only one building in camp the ""main house"" that can be used as a space for rainy or inclement weather programming. Limiting what the camp can do in bad weather. As it is, we have to push all the tables back to have classes while scrunched into a little space and lug equipment up from the lake to store it in the same place where we have meals. But what’s so incredible is that the Volunteer Builders organization in Ontario has chosen Ak-O-Mak as a worthy, non-profit camp to be the recipient of their 2019 construction project! The volunteers come in with all of the skills–the carpenters, electricians, architects–and do all the work free of charge. They are set to build this multi-purpose building. All we need to do is provide the materials. So, the goal of this fundraiser is to help them help us. THE CAMPCamp Ak-O-Mak is Canada’s premier sports camp for girls. It was founded in 1928 as the world’s first swimming and sports camp for girls and has been a non-profit since 2016. It offers girls aged 7-16 a unique program of competitive swimming, open water swimming, triathlon, sprint canoe and kayak racing. In addition to these pillar sports, Ak-O-Mak offers instructional programs in more than 25 other sports and activities. Many of the campers have gone on to become All-Americans and even Olympians. Here, the campers enjoy an authentic Canadian camp experience in a beautiful, wilderness setting. The camp itself has remained rustic and “unplugged”, so girls can experience the wonder of nature – sometimes for the very first time! In 2018, I attended the 90-year anniversary reunion event at Camp Ak-O-Mak. Sitting beside old friends, my heart was won over and over again. So many sweet and wonderful memories. I think back about how the water comes alive as the we pierce its stillness, how strong we felt in the war canoe, how brave we felt jumping off the tower. Before my visit, I would’ve never believed camp could be the same, that it would ever be as good as it was. But I was wrong– camp is better than ever. THE COSTS (aka…. Where your money goes!) Estimate costs associated with the construction of the Pavilion are as follows:Once the cost of the pavilion is covered, additional monies will be directed towards other badly-needed infrastructure improvements: 1. New wood/log bench/picnic tables for water front of main dock, boat house, and beach2. New and larger housing unit/racks and storage systems for the paddle boards and kayaks3. Boat house structural repairs and additional storage space4. Main house electrical and structural repairs5. Painting for main house, guest house, work trailers, director’s cabin, and boat houseTHE ASKIt's simple: Will you join me in helping Ak-O-Mak build a Pavilion and improve camp infrastructure?Any amount you can donate to this cause will be put toward building spaces to revitalize the camp and, therefore, building a better future for our girls and ensuring a future for camp.If you can’t donate at this time, you can still help get the word out. Share this link to your Facebook Timeline and tag anyone who you believes in girls, this mission, and the camp experience. (Anyone know Justin Trudeau or Ellen?! Let’s get them involved…) Either way, let’s continue to find ways to support and and develop brave strong girls.THE RACEOne more thing! This fundraising effort has motivated me to, in true Ak-O-Mak fashion, do something I’ve never done before. Early this year, I decided to train to complete the 37th Run of the Charles, one of Boston's Premier Paddling Races and the largest flat-bottomed boat race in New England. The race, for me, is a symbol of my commitment to the fundraising task ahead. It will run on April 28, 2019, so I only have three months to take on two monumental tasks: train for the race and raise $50,000 for Ak-O-Mak. I can't do it alone, and I'd sure appreciate having you by my side.Every little bit helps, and I thank you so much.","January 16, 2019","$21,058","$50,000 "

He is now under threat himself, being targeted in a lawfare* lawsuit designed to silence him.He started this GoFundMe campaign in an initiative he calls “Operation: Kill Switch”, to bring his evidence to the superior court and on the public record but requires funds to be able to make this happen. The evidence exists, yet without a carefully crafted defence, the evidence could get suppressed. This may sound like a fringe issue, outside of mainstream relevance, but the story hasn’t been widely carried by mainstream media because it exposes issues that many don’t want to address for fear of professional reprisal. Campaign donors have described Tom as a “true patriot” and have applauded him for his bravery and dedication to free speech and democracy in Canada. In the foreword to his book, Submission: The Danger of Political Islam to Canada – With a Warning to America, Raheel Raza, president of Muslims Facing Tomorrow, writes, “… the authors in this ground-breaking work have done all Westerners a favour by opening avenues for major discussion and debate that should have taken place right after 9/11 but which could not happen due to vested subversive agendas of the regressive left and the extreme right. With great risks to their lives, these authors have dared to say what many Canadians need to hear – like yesterday”.To win this case and push back at this organization’s aggressive bullying tactic cannot be taken lightly. They have considerable financial resources and support from numerous other powerful organizations and Tom needs your help for justice to prevail.Operation: Kill Switch asks why a federally-registered taxpayer-subsidized charitable organization, with alleged links to nefarious activities, still has charitable status? Why does the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and many of his caucus members have such strong ties to these types of organizations? Should taxpayer-funded charities be allowed to target our military veterans with your money? -> Help us protect this military veteran who continues to fight to keep our society (and us) safe from this growing problem.-> Help us expose these organizations and their members for their alleged nefarious connections by supporting our campaign now.Speak up and act while you still can.

En Tea ,"Vancouver, BC",Community & Neighbors,"Background: 20 years ago, in September 1997, community members of the Downtown Eastside rallied for government action in addressing and responding to the rapidly increasing number of deaths from opiate related overdoses and HIV in. This community, grassroots movement was led by key activists, one of whom was the late Bud Osborn. For the demonstration, community members built and planted 1,000 crosses in openheimer park and blocked traffic on Main and Hastings. This demonstration resulted in the formation of VANDU, the first peer run safer injection site and eventually in 2008 the opening of Insite, the first legally sanctioned and operated Safe injection site in North America. It was a pivotal moment in the shift in drug policy in Vancouver. It created a ripple effect that has saved the lives of thousands.Collective Resistance to Injustice (CRI) is organizing a commemoration to the community's initial action in 1997 by collaborating with community members/collectives and key organizers to recreate this event, highlighting the current number of individuals lost to the Opiate overdose epidemic in British Columbia (2,224 deaths over 3 years). Moreover, we are partnering with organizers in cities across Canada to encourage local demonstrations to similarly identify the impact of overdose deaths and to deliver these symbols to Parliament. Facebook Event (local - Coast Salish Territory): https://tinyurl.com/yb9b6grv With the recent report released that the Federal government is not willing to decriminalize illicit opiates and the ever increasing number of overdoses impacting users, frontline workers, emergency services, and draining resources- We say: enough is enough. This action serves to pressure the government to shift their approach to drug policy, listen to community members, include them in conversations about drug policy, to address this as a national emergency, and increase accessibility to the kind of care community members have asked for across Canada. This Gofund me campaign will do the following: - Pay for supplies necessary to build crosses (total number 2,224) (approx. $400)- Pay for labour in assembling the crosses (community members will be invited to assemble to crosses, connect with each other and share in food and coffee/tea) $20/hr of labour - anticipating between 32-40 hrs of labour needed $640-800 - Pay for the transport of crosses/pick up of crosses from other provinces ($3,000)In place of donations, we are also seeking support in other ways. If you are able to volunteer time, offer supplies, or food donations please email us (see below).Policy Change Letter: We will also be circulating a letter that will address the policy changes that have been demanded by organizations such as CAPUD, VANDU, and additions made by CRI and other advocacy groups across Canada. The letter will be directed to the health minister (Ginette Petitpas Taylor) and prime minister Justin Trudeau in addition to BC NDP Leader (John Horgan), and the ministers assigned to oversee the response to the overdose crisis in BC (Judy Darcy and Adrian Dix). Similar letters will be and have been circulating in other provinces and territories.  If you are interested in signing your name to the letter please email us at the address below. Thank you for supporting community members, thank you for responding to Overdoses.

Gregg Purcell ,"Verdun, QC","Creative Arts, Music & Film","UPDATE 2020/02/20 -  Hey Everybody, Just wanted to let you all know that I will be providing updates regularly.  So check back often to stay updated.I do realize that this will be a bit of a process and that I most likely will have to begin production in small steps to be able to garner more donations. So when I reach the $1500 mark, I will begin shooting some interviews and will develop a teaser trailer.I really appreciate all the shares and retweets you have all been doing. It helps  a lot. (Scroll down below video to read full description on the project)                                                      Hello everybody,We are all aware of the shape that Canada is in today... Not good. We are quite possibly on the last legs of Canadian values. We have a ""leader"" who is dead set on changing our identity completely.All of our nations establishment political parties have no plans on changing the direction we are headed. Only the People's Party of Canada does. It does not seem as though the PPC has much of a chance of getting into the position to make those changes though. Why? Because their exposure is minimal and the Left wing controlled mainstream media will never give them any fair or honest coverage.So, what can we do to change that? Well, each of us must give and do what we as single individuals are able to give and do. We are the ""People"" in People's Party after all.For me personally, it is film work. Film work that can expose what the party is all about to citizens.I reached out to Maxime Bernier (Head of the PPC) on Twitter and offered my services to the party. The individual who manages his social media account responded that they just do not have the funds at this time to hire me. Which is understandable because they are still a new up and coming party.So I have decided that I want to make a documentary. I want this to be a good documentary that people can watch and give credibility to, and that just can't be done with no money.So I am looking to get $20,000 for it.I am well aware that $20,000 is absolute peanuts when it comes to film making. But I am just looking for the bare minimum possible. I do know that even getting this amount has a very small chance of happening because everybody is going through very rough times in this country right now, including myself. Damn, it's the reason we're all so fed up with the way things are, isn't it?I want to make clear that this would be a completely independent project and is not an authorized project by the PPC. It will be done from my own individual purview, which will make it better and a lot more credible if you ask me. Not propagandist driven.I also want to make sure everyone knows that this will not be a project to make profit with. I feel the need  to do whatever I can to open Canadian's eyes up and have them realize the only common sense platform there is to insure them, their children and their grandchildren have a decent future in this country.So this documentary will be uploaded free for everybody to see and share on every platform. Some of the issues I would tackle in this documentary are:- How & why the PPC came to fruition- Exposing Justin Trudeau's blatant corruption and how his government is giving Canada completely away-Immigration - The United Nation's stronghold over our CountryBut most importantly...-Going in depth and explaining what the policies on each parties platform actually mean. A lot of people (I'd say most people actually) vote with blindness to what anything they are voting for even means. They watch the mainstream media and choose who's voice they like more when hitting talking points on issues that mean absolutely nothing at all.For example, the thing that stuck out most to me about the PPC platform was the abolishment of the Capital Gains Tax.I guarantee you, you can ask 50 people what the Capital Gains Tax is and at least 35 of them won't have a single clue about it.There are many other things to cover as well, I am just giving a brief rundown.If the money can be raised, here is what it would go towards,- Transportation & low cost motel's if interviews can be garnered in different cities with certain people. (People running for MP positions in different ridings, PPC Members, Experts on the different issues we would be covering, and hopefully if it could be possible, Maxime Bernier himself)- Minimal equipment rentals- Help with different aspects of the production- If anything leftover, Money for myself to live with as this would take a big chunk of my life, both time wise and work wise. I want to thank everybody for even reading this far.If this money can be generated by mid March I will immediately begin production.If it can't be, that is completely understandable, as I said, I'm aware it is rough times for everybody these days.If somehow even more than the $20,000 I am asking for is raised, That would give me more to work with for the project and would literally be life changing for myself.Thanks A lot everybody,- Gregg Purcell (A.K.A Gordon Burling) ","February 13, 2020",$645,"$20,000 "
Shane Caldeira ,"Sacramento, CA","Missions, Faith & Church","I am a born again Christian rooted in Christ and the fundamental teachings of the Bible, and a member of the Body of Christ according to His will and purposes.I believe God loves us (John 3:16) and is a Spirit (John 4:24) and was made flesh as a man (Christ Jesus - 1 Timothy 3:16) and died for us as atonement for our sins (Hebrews 9:22) allowing us to be new creatures in Him by receiving His Holy Spirit. (2 Corinthians 5:19, John 1).After the crucifixtion, Jesus rose from the dead on the third day as a guarantee and first fruits of the ressurection and He supped with His disciples (Acts 10:41), and was received up into glory (Acts 1:8-11), to be High Priest (High Priest 9:11) and Lord Almighty forevermore (Isaiah 9:6-7).Therefore, we can be born again by believing in the gospel, confessing that He (Jesus) is the Lord and Savior (Roman's 10:9), confessing and turning away from sin and forgiving all men for their trespasses against us. Walking in faith and righteousness, we keep His commandments, and are guided and comforted by His Spirit. From the Bible (John 14), we can see that Elohim, the Most High God, is in 3 parts yet is 1 - meaning that God is comprised of the Father (Great Spirit), the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Ghost.From studying the Torah, known also as the Old Testament, we can see Jesus was prophesied to come long before He was born to a virgin (Isaiah 7:14), and is the Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6), and He bore our sins as an innocent lamb (Isaiah 53).I had believed in Christ Jesus at a very young age, although I had never became fully rooted in Him and the gospel. I fell away from the faith more than once, and in the latter I was baptized by the Holy Spirit after becoming entrenched in the New Age religion and fasting for many days in desperation, with a heavy conscience, and of a contrite spirit. I believe the Lord has called me to be a watchman and to lead people to Him in these last days. According to Bible prophesy, it is apparent to me that we are in the last days before the Man of Sin deceives the world and great Tribulation befalls the ungodly. As prophesy declares, the birth pains or sorrows are increasing rapidly according to Matthew 24. Also, today's generation appears to be the generation described in:- 2 Peter 3- 2 Timothy 3- 1 Thessalonians 5- 2 Thessalonians 2I can see the final beast system forming before my very eyes (Daniel 7), as Pope Francis is calling all nations and religions to come together - a great falling away from faith in Christ and of sound doctrine (2 Thess. 2). The Pope is working toward a global database of digital identities to be secured for the Mark of the Beast (RFID Chip most likely) in a one world cashless currency. This was all prophesied of in the Book of Revelations 13-14, 20:4. We see the stage being set for the Man of Sin to come into power and establish a 7 year peace covenant (Daniel 9:27), as all of the nations are coming against Jerusalem (Zechariah 12, Ezekiel 38) after the declaration made by Trump in December 2017, where Jerusalem was named the capitol as Israel in the name of ""peace and security"" as declared in 1 Thessalonians 5:3. I believe the Man of Sin is probably Obama (or perhaps Justin Trudeau), as many people on YouTube have had dreams and visions (Acts 2:17) of him being the Anti-Christ. I also had a bad dream about Obama on Christmas 2017. On February 4, 2018, I believe it was God who woke me up after I went to sleep after prayer and He whispered powerfully ""he's here, he's here"" indicating the Man of Sin is here. This was confirmed by another brother in Christ Brandon Jay on Facebook. In June 2018, a prophet told us after a prayer meeting that the Beast, the evil one, is on the Earth preparing his army and is going to persecute the Christians (Daniel 7:20-21, Revelation 13:7) and that the new temple in Jerusalem will suddenly be built for the evil one to falsely sit on Yahweh's throne.Obama is favored around the world as he is traveling the world and establishing connections with various world leaders, holding global summits to bring about change, and has formerly declared the U.S. to no longer be a Christian Nation. See YouTube for more information. This is all occurring amidst civil riots and liberal movements in opposition to Trump and his pro-Christian stance. I believe America will receive judgement for all of her sins and apostasy as the Great Harlot that sits on many waters who rebels against The Most High, and even many lukewarm Christians will be cast into tribulation and/or given over to a strong delusion (2 Thessalonians 2:11) unless they repent. I believe many will be rounded up into FEMA concentration camps, and Christians will be persecuted.I do believe the faithful church of Philadelphia (Revelation 3:10-11) will be spared (raptured - 1 Cor 15:52) before the hour of trial (Daniel's 70th week).In these dark days, we must strengthen our faith in Christ and walk according to His commandments despite prevailing Christian harassment and persecution. We must be wise, and wait and watch for His coming, as a spotless bride waits for her groom upon the wedding day (Matthew 25).We wrestle not against flesh and blood but with evil spirits in unseen realms; therefore, we must not be ignorant of Satan's devices and schemes and to put on our full armor of God as Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy (Ephesians 6).My Parable of the Vineyard Interviewhttps://youtu.be/H9CHTd2IFsQ________________Written by Shane Caldeirahttp://trumpetforyahweh.blogspot.com","January 25, 2018","$4,159","$4,000 "
Esther Stenzler ,"North York, ON",Other," 
Today, I am reaching out to you to help support Jeremy's journey to recovery. This Go-Fund-Me campaign will help Jeremy continue treatment both in Toronto and New York that includes a strict regimen of antibiotic prescriptions, supplements and herbals, supportive therapies, testing, and a highly restricted diet. With your help, Jeremy can begin to heal and live the life that he once had.
 In early 2016, Jeremy was tested positive for Lyme's disease and two other co-infections. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection primarily transmitted by Ixodes ticks, also known as deer ticks, and on the West Coast, black-legged ticks. Lyme is called “The Great Imitator,” because its symptoms mimic many other diseases. It can affect any organ of the body, including the brain and nervous system, muscles and joints, and the heart. (https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-basics/lyme-disease/about-lyme/)   The two co-infections Jeremy was diagnosed with are Bartonella and Babesia. Bartonella is bacteria that lives primarily inside the lining of the blood vessels. Patients with this co-infection suffer relapses because Bartonella periodically cycles into red blood cells, which may provide a protective niche for the bacteria. Similarly, Babesia is a malaria-like parasite, also called a “piroplasm,” that infects red blood cells. A person with a co-infection generally experiences more severe illness, more symptoms, and a longer road to recovery. 
 In Jeremy's case, his diagnosis has left him experiencing very debilitating symptoms: struggling for air (""air hunger""), chest pain, tremors, fatigue, and tightness of throat. Jeremy, a true warrior, often hides his symptoms from others. He battles the side-effects of his illness in silence as he goes about out his daily activities. Simple activities such as walking, writing, and reading are often a struggle for Jeremy.
 Patients with Lyme disease are frequently misdiagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and various psychiatric illnesses, including depression. Misdiagnosis with these other diseases may delay the correct diagnosis and treatment as the underlying infection progresses unchecked (https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-basics/lyme-disease/about-lyme/). Jeremy is one of these patients. Within the past year, he has been misdiagnosed with both anxiety and depression, two of the most common psychological effects of Lyme Disease. Six months later, he finally took the IGeneX blood testing which confirmed his diagnoses of Lyme disease, Bartonella, and Babesia.
With careful research, we found Dr. Maureen McShane in Plattsburg New York, who has been treating him with antibiotics, supplements, and IV to help combat his illness. The cost of the initial consultation was 1,000.00 US, each email Jeremy sends is 250.00 US, and a brief 15-minute phone conversation is 350.00 US. Each month, medication costs $500.00, IV treatments are $400.00 US, and supplements cost $400.00 US. While not in New York, Dr. McShane advised seeing a local doctor in Toronto for treatment.  Monthly visits to the Toronto clinic costs $500.00 CA. On average, Jeremy's monthly costs for treatment and doctor visits amount to $2,500 CA. These monthly payments have taken a toll on us both.  
 I spend all my days with my son, taking him to doctor's appointments, and lending him my endless support and care. As a mother, it's heart wrenching to watch your child suffer. But I know I'm not alone. ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 300,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease in the US every year. That’s 1.5 times the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer, and six times the number of people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS each year in the US."" (https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-basics/lyme-disease/about-lyme/) In Canada, 500 cases of Lyme disease was reported in 2014 but expects 10,000 Canadians will be infected annually by 2020. (http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/lyme-disease-definitely-spreading-in-canada-expert-warns-1.2422869) While the US recognizes the severity of this disease, Canada does not. In this country, we do not have the proper support for treating Lyme Disease and its co-infections. Canadians continue to travel to the US for Lyme disease testing and treatment. Currently, there is a lack of education, research, and treatment in Canada. This needs to change. I have sent letters to Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) of Ontario, Canada's Parliament, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Health Ministers, and Toronto Newspapers with no feedback.
With all our efforts working with Doctors in New York and Naturopathic Doctors in Toronto Jeremy requires further treatment that is not offered in Canada to get better, My son’s immune system has become compromised from this disease and desperately needs stem cell replacement, which will boost his immune system. We are planning to take him to a well know clinic in Germany specializing in treatment for Lyme’s Disease and hope by February to set out on his road to recovery. The procedure will involve using Jeremy’s own blood; the doctor’s harvest his own healthy stem cells, modulate his immune system, kill the harmful bacteria and other pathogens, detoxify his body from other bio-toxins and then re-introduce healthy stem cells in Jeremy’s body. This 4- week intensive treatment is 50,000.00 and we have our first appointment with this doctor who is flying to Toronto to meet with Jeremy and other chronically sick people.
This is the first time I have reached out to the general public to help Jeremy receive the proper Healthcare that he deserves. Upon Jeremy's recovery, he hopes to help others with their battle by raising Lyme awareness in Canada, support education, and research towards this disease. I do hope this story of my son will wake up the Canadian Medical field and our Health Care System.  I continue to support my son but unfortunately, we can’t cover treatments and the ongoing medical bills. I ask you please to share Jeremy’s story and if you can kindly make a donation that will go directly to funding the treatments he needs so desperately. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Derek Armstrong ,"Sault Ste Marie, ON",Community & Neighbors,"NOTE: Even though we have completed our project, we are still in a credit balance from the expense of travel and lodging by about $3200 dollars. If anyone wishes to contribute to help clear this balance it would be greatly appreciated. All funds have and can be accounted for.Thank you.April 12th, 2016:   What is happening to our Canadian youth when you listen to the news lately? How can such a rich and vibrant country have so much despair, depression and just no feeling of hope in the minds and hearts of our northern youth?I am told it is just a small percentage that are in this suicide crisis and not the entire youth of the community in general. But it does affect everyone when a family member or friend tries to take their life. Those individual youths urgently need the help of medical professionals and counsellors to help them sort out the current and future situation in their life. But the youth in general need more than that. They need their spirits lifted, they need a bit of fun and they need to feel what it’s like to laugh once again, feel that they can have goals, know they can speak out and someone will listen. That is where we come in. We are a group of Canadian, talented individuals…ok well I’m just the coordinator that’s about all the talent I have but I have a caring heart. We are organizing a visit to Attawapiskat to hold workshops, mentor, inspire while we entertain and listen to the dreams of those who feel so alone and to those who want to help them. All photos are interactive...click on them!First on the list is Dakota House , a Cree Actor - born in Manning, Alberta and Dakota grew up in an inner-city neighborhood in Edmonton.  Best known for his role as Tee Vee Tenia on the CBC Series ""North of 60"", Dakota has starred in numerous feature films and made numerous guest star appearances in shows such as Heartland and the X- Files.​ A father of 4 with over a decade of sobriety and his background in Martial Arts, Dakota prides himself on being a strong role model for youth. For over two decades he has devoted much of his time to educating youth on motivation, self- esteem and making positive choices. He has traveled across Canada extensively, bringing hope and inspiration to youth through keynote presentations, youth conferences and other special events.Joining Dakota is Scott Ward , born in Selkirk, Manitoba and is of Ojibway/Métis background.  In addition to bringing laughter and entertainment to communities, organizations and schools, Scott is well known for his work with Dakota House and is heavily immersed in working with youth and was a past recipient of an Alberta Aboriginal Youth Role Model Award , an Alberta Business Award of Distinction (Youth Entrepreneur), as well as being a 2015 recipient of the Native American 40 under 40 award. Scott Ward now travels extensively across North America as a full-time Comedy Hypnotist and Motivational Speaker.  Both Dakota and Scott are involved with Going M.I.L.E.S which is a leadership initiative, created for the sole purpose of fostering a positive environment for Indigenous youth to grow and interact with today's top Indigenous talent, through the medium of the arts. With Indigenous peoples being one of the fastest demographics growing today, a change is needed to lead a more healthy lifestyle with the chance of positive expression, which is at an all-time low.With professional positive role models, Going Miles is a program developed to ensure our youth get to experience the potential they have in themselves to create and believe in seeing their thoughts and ideas come to life. In Addition we have Shy-Anne Hovorka from the Thunder Bay area. Shy-Anne is an award-winning songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, humanitarian and performer, whose first three albums have sold copies around the world. Shy-Anne is also a highly respected motivational speaker whose presentations have inspired thousands of Canadians. Shy-Anne enjoys involving youth with music every chance she has.Click on a song:Can't Change The World What about me? Run Run Run Fire Silver Gypsy  Recently confirmed, Sean Watson  has joined our mission to empower the youth. Sean Watson's ""Motivational Magic"" is inspiring, fun and an educational performance that motivates students to be all they can be. His positive attitude and magical approach to life, combined with his hilarious tricks and jaw-dropping illusions make Sean a memorable hit each and every time he performs. Sean connects with the students as he explains his own struggles in school as a child with learning disabilities. The show promotes peer acceptance, overcoming adversity and believing in oneself.So, in all we have four great people who want to help bring the spark back in the hearts of so many Attawapiskat youth. We are not sure of the dates as of yet but will publish them shortly. It is all dependent on funds we can secure and how fast.Our funding campaign is not about raising funds for the community. It’s about raising funds to cover costs for this group to get there, for flights, meals and accommodations while there. These artists are donating their time to mentor, inspire and entertain these youth on more than just a fun level. They all have experience working with youth, guiding them, developing goals and self appreciation. It is more than any amount of money can bring the children. Please help and give what you can. Only a few dollars from many can go a long way. Well we did challenge Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  to join us but appears he will beat us there. He will visit Attawapiskat June 13th, 2016 to meet with the Chiefs and will take time to share with the youth talking and listening to what they need and want so they can be a proud Canadian. It is wonderful he has not forgotten, realizes they are not unloved...as they are, Children of Canada. Prime Minister Trudeau says he listens to the people of Canada. It appears he is doing just that. These young people are reaching out and just want to be heard. Now is their chance. Thank you from our hearts….let’s make a difference now! This is when it counts. http://www.goingmiles.org/http://www.scottward.net/ http://shy-anne.com/bio/ http://www.watsonsmagic.com/ We would like to acknowledge our gratitude toward some incredible financial assistance for our project. Thank you from our hearts!Notes: Since the inception of this campaign we have adjusted the campaign goal from $30,000 down to $15,000 and now an adjustment to $5,000 after receiving donations to date, some corporate assistance and reviewing most of the common flights and expenses. Well, Most of the expenses have been paid. Todate, flights for most of us to Timmins cost us $3237, flights from Timmins to Attawapiskat cost us $4028 and rooms will cost us $1400 for a total of $8665. Food has been estimated and hoping offers to keep us fed will happen!Three other flights have been covered by generous donations saving us $3086 apart from the $8665. So yes, very expensive to fly five people to Attawapiskat, totalling over $11750 for this project.Gofund donations less fees and direct contributions have totalled $5208 towards these expenses, less flight donations of $3086. So on our last journey to departure we have adjusted the goal to our total need to cover expenses of $8664 (less $5208 already...need $3456 more).Again, this campaign is not about money for the community nor is it about politics. We strongly feel that the colaborated efforts of these speakers and artists will bring more help and empowerment to the youth than any amount of money is worth. We really hope you can feel the same way and help us to still cover our expenses. The funds have been primarily for flights, accommodations and meals for members attending this event. And even though we never planned for the luxury side of value the booking, distance and flight schedules all came into play for what we paid. Any and all inquiries about accountability or personal contact details are welcome by sending a direct email using the link under my name here. We are all professionals, we are accountable and we will be open and honest about our diligent spending of these funds.  Thanks Accounting to Date: as of July 25th, 2016Gofundme and direct contributions todate - Account showing fees. ","April 12, 2016","$2,953","$6,212 "

Fareed Khan ,"Aylmer South, QC",Accidents & Emergencies,"Human Rights & Justice Support Fund (Fareed Khan)Support for social justice and human rights is one of my core values.  For years I have worked to support causes rooted in fundamental principles of justice, particularly where it concerns the vulnerable, the oppressed and the dispossessed.  I have done this without monetary compensation and dedicated thousands of volunteer hours to various social justice causes, especially where it concerns human rights and basic human dignity.  Some of the peoples and causes I have worked and spoken out on behalf of include: the Rohingya, the people of Kashmir and the Muslim minorities in India, Uyghurs in China, Indigenous Canadians, against hate, bigotry and racism in Canada and elsewhere, and in support of Palestinians.Sadly, it is my efforts to speak for the persecuted and oppressed people of Palestine that has made me a target of Israeli state sponsored intimidation.  As a result, my efforts to continue to be a voice in defence of human rights are now under threat.Added to this, a recent serious car accident in December 2019 has severely strained me financially and in terms of my health, and therefore required me to make this appeal in order that I may continue to do the work that is so important, and to pursue possible legal action against those who have targeted me.Last spring (2019) I challenged the brutality of the Israeli government in its treatment of Palestinians, and called for support for the BDS movement by Toronto Raptors fans.  As a result I have now become the target of a campaign of character assassination by the ""Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs"", an organization with links to the Israeli military. (https://canadadocs.org/tag/fareed-khan/) In response to a statement last spring by Toronto Raptors co-owner Larry Tanenbaum that the Raptors would visit Israel if they won the NBA championship  I called for all Raptors supporters (but particularly Muslim supporters) to launch a social media campaign to Raptors players to refuse to visit Israel in an effort to ""sportswash"" Israeli atrocities and brutality.   I shared this on multiple social media platforms that reached tens of thousands of people.  For this act of standing up for the long oppressed Palestinian people I am now on the radar of the Israeli government and its affiliated private organizations who make it their business to attack, delegitimize, and assassinate the character of anyone with a voice and platform who supports the Palestinian cause.Since my initial public call for supporting Palestinians and boycotting Israel I have received a number of online threats, as well as one death threat.However, I will not be silenced!All of the human rights and social justice work I do still needs to be done.  But now I have to do it under the shadow of an implicit threat by the very well-funded and Israel affiliated voices that justify oppression, brutality and murder of innocent Palestinians.Palestinians still need a voice to speak out for them.  The Rohingya, Uyghurs, Kashmiris, Indo-Muslims, and oppressed minorities in other parts of the world still need people speaking out and working on their behalf.  But the work that I do can only continue now if the threats against me are challenged through the generosity of supporters and donors.  This funding will cover the most basic of costs, which will primarily relate to legal consultations, transportation and communications expenses in support of social justice, human rights causes, and anti-racism causes.Below are links to a list of media interviews and public statements related to some of the above issues.While I have the energy, willingness and commitment to continue doing this work, none of it can continue without your generous support.Greater than the death of flesh is the death of hope and the death of dreams.  Those whose lives are engulfed in these perils need our understanding, help and support so that their lives once again have meaning and purpose.It is my goal that the work I do in support of social justice and human rights causes helps those facing and suffering from violent oppression and persecution at the hands of powerful forces who are destroying the hopes and dreams of tens of millions of peaceful people in different parts of the world.Sincerely,Fareed Khan**************CTV News ChannelTalking on CTV News Channel about the ""report card"" put out by the Rohingya Human Rights Network giving the Canadian

Erin RobotGrrl ,"Ottawa, ON",Education & Learning,"I love making robots, and now have the opportunity to extend this to space applications at the International Space University SSP19!Hi everyone!I have been accepted to the International Space University - Summer Studies Program 2019 . This intensive and competitive program brings together people from around the world to learn the breadth of topics surrounding space. Leaders in the space sector and future astronauts have participated in this program. The 2019 edition takes place in Strasbourg, France from mid-June to mid-August.This is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. I'm searching for scholarships and sponsors who would be interested in helping make this possible.By backing my Gofundme campaign, you're going to help make it happen.I've been fortunate enough to receive a generous half scholarship from the European Space Agency. (Thank you, ESA!)After the scholarship, now the total amount required for tuition, lodging, and food, is 8250 Euros ($12,558.25 CAD) before April 30th. I'm asking for your help to raise $1000 CAD towards this amount. I'm pitching sponsors and applying to scholarships to (hopefully) supplement for the remainder... as well as working my tail off to self-fund for the transportation costs.To be completely transparent: Going to ISU requires a lot of funds to raise in a very short amount of time. It's possible that this may or may not work out. Right now, we're planning for this to work. If it doesn't, then we'll make a new plan, and the funds would go towards Robot Missions.Above: Presenting the robot's AI demo at the Season Finale Field Test. Photo by Petr Maur.I love making robots and teaching people about them. This lead me to start Robot Missions, where we develop low-cost 3D printed robots to tackle the plastic pollution challenge.

Including demonstrating the robots with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna, Minister of Science and Sport Kirsty Duncan, and even more. It's even lead to testing the robots at the Canadian Space Agency and presenting at the Rockefeller Foundation. Above: Working on the robot's power supply.

Samantha VanderBeek ,"Toronto, ON",Non-Profits & Charities,"As some of you may know, I've been working on a documentary about the refugee crisis in Greece with an organization called Forge for Humanity.Some Background:After the EU/Turkey deal in March of 2016, the EU borders were closed off to refugees.  Any remaining refugees in Greece were to be processed, and, if deemed safe to do so, would be sent back to Turkey. In return for preventing any more asylum seekers from crossing EU land or sea borders, Turkey was given 3 billion euro and ""safe third party"" status as to avoid any refoulment by the EU with another 3 billion to come later. Essentially, the deal was a way of shoving the remaining refugees out of the EU and locking them out. However, in the process, 50-65 thousand asylum seekers have confined within Greek borders almost entirely neglected by the aslym system with more coming in every day. Waiting times for asylum interviews in Greece range from 6 months to 2 years. Some have shown up to interviews to be told that their caseworkers aren't in that day and have had their interviews postponed another year. Many are bound to un-winterized camps or live on the streets. Greece's unemployment rate is around 20%, so for those asylum seekers looking for independence, finding work is scarce, desperately so, no matter their skill set or how many languages they speak.  Refugees in Greece are being held in what is effectively a national detainment centre without information, resources, support, or, for many, what feels like a future. They are without agency or opportunity, and they weather it in the hopes that one day their wait might lead to a better life. Being ""safe"" is not enough. Many humanitarian organizations are calling what is happening in Greece a mental health emergency. These people are trapped. Stuck between violence or persecution and a never-ending wall of mismanaged bureaucracy. Their choices are to continue to endure a horrific quality of life or go back and face persecution, forced military or militia service or death based on sexual orientation, religion, or political affiliation. In the meantime, they live in fear in Greece, a quiet fear borne out of a period of inhumane waiting and a condition of living that is unacceptable to any person. These teachers, students, photographers, developers, engineers, cooks, carpenters, plasterers are living in squalor. Told they're just a number. Not a human being. As you can tell, I feel quite passionately about this, which is why I'm asking for your help. FORGE for Humanity provides occupational and psychosocial support (and really, so much more) to single male refugees, a forgotten demographic within the already struggling asylum system in Greece. A study by the International Rescue Committee at the height of the refugee crisis in 2016 in Lebanon, for example, found that 9 out of 10 single male refugees had not received aid in the last 30 days, nearly a third believed they were ineligible to register with UN because they were not married or with children. Even Justin Trudeau's refugee policies exclude single men from applying for asylum in Canada. There are many assumptions about why single men are more resilient and thus less deserving, and while many may be justifiable, if you imagine your brother, your father, or your son ever being in this situation, it becomes harder expect their resilience simply based on their gender.  This is where Forge steps in. Many major charities and the asylum system as a whole do not prioritize single men, but these men are still in need of help. They are in need of legal guidance. They are in need of emotional and occupational support. They are in need of sleeping bags and new shoes. They are in need. In support of and repayment for the kindness, generosity, and openness the people at Forge and the men they work with have shown me, I would like to ask you to donate to their work. Forge is run by two incredible young women, and, to be honest with you, I don't know how they breathe, eat, sleep - They don't stop. They're the ability to find joy, their compassion, and determination to support these young men is endless and inspiring. They are bright lights in a pretty dark situation. They started this charity after working at another camp in Greece in 2016 where they recognized the under-served needs of men within asylum services, and since then, Forge is all they have done - 10 hour days, 6 day weeks, and those are just their office hours.  On personal hours they can be found taking beneficiaries to hospitals, house viewings, job interviews, legal appointments. These girls are committed to seeing this crisis through and helping these men and the refugee community, at large, achieve a better quality of life. They are a community centre. They are a guidance centre. They are a place to forget or alleviate troubles. The charity strictly runs off donations - the office, internet, supplies. These girls are the service, and they're not even paying themselves. For the next couple of weeks, I'll be posting information and stories about the organization and some of the men they're working with. I would ask you to donate to help support their work, support these men or to research and find a charity in Greece that speaks to you. The crisis isn't over; It's just changed. There's still so much more we can and should do.http://www.forgeforhumanity.org/","September 9, 2018",600 $,"5,000 $ "
Aaron Bedard ,"White Rock, BC",Other,"In the 2015 election, JUSTIN TRUDEAU PROMISED a pension in his veteran platform and won a right wing vote and majority on that promise specifically. 18 months later now and no further pension talks are planned.

Chala Speciale ,"Toronto, ON","Medical, Illness & Healing","I have a 57 year old father currently living in Cyprus who is seriously ill with Lupus. This chronic autoimmune disease causes his body to become hyperactive and attack the normal, healthy tissues inside of him. The disease has already affected his mobility as he can only sit upright for 1 hour at a time, he cannot walk, he can only eat small amounts of liquid food, he has gangrene in his one toe that must be removed, he has lost feeling in one leg and one arm, he is losing mobility in his joints and limbs, he is losing his eye sight in one of his eyes, his teeth are falling out, he is in diapers, and he is down to around 97 pounds at 6 feet tall. My Father, Andy, is literally falling apart. This has all happened within a 7 month span as he has always been a healthy, fit, and physically active man. He is rapidly declining. In addition, my Father does not have money to afford food, vitamins or pay for his live-in nurse, electrical bills, hydro etc. back in Cyprus as he is out of work. These are vital necessities that he requires in order to stay alive. His shelves at home are empty. Due to my Father's serious health issues, the cost of flying him to Canada with a fully equipped medical team is overwhelming and very expensive. I am reaching out to everyone for help. I have created this crowd-funded campaign called Fight For Dad in order to achieve the following: 1. Raise funds to send my father money for food, vitamins, running water, electricty and to pay for a medical flight to Canada. Hopefully the money raised can also go towards helping him start a new life here in Canada.2. Give my Father access to the Canadian healthcare system (he has been a Canadian Citizen since the early 1980's) because  he feels he is not getting the proper treatment in Cyprus.PROBLEM: OHIP requires residents to meet ""Physical Presence Requirements"" and establish residency within Ontario for a period of 3 months before coverage kicks in. My Father cannot wait the 3 months because he would die. My family can't afford hundreds of thousands of dollars in uncovered medical treatment unfortunately.
3. My only option for ""help"" is to reach out to the Ohip Eligibility Review Committee (OERC) to try and waive this 3 month waiting period.PROBLEM: I have learned that appeals are denied by both the Ontario Eligibility Review Committee and the Board because they lack the jurisdiction to exercise any discretion in regards to the 3 month waiting period.  These laws are governed and put in place by OHIP, above them. The public, including new applicants are not aware of this. The OERC is a government committee put in place to give family members such as myself a false sense of hope. I have notified the OERC that I plan to go to the media with my story and they didn't seem happy about this. I have also written to Premier Kathleen Wynne, Mayor John Tory, MPP Glenn Murray, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Minister of Health and Long Term Care, Dr. Eric Hoskins.  I will not stop until my Father's 3 month waiting period is waived and changes are made to our legal system.  I am working on this around the clock as time is extremely precious to us.The website below regarding the OERC is extremely misleading: http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/publications/ohip/review.aspxMy Mission: 1. Save my Dad's life by financially supporting him while fighting  to have the 3 month OHIP waiting period waived2. Create a Compassionate Clause that would allow people such as my Father who require immediate medical attention to be able to access OHIP the moment they get to Ontario - provided they are Canadian Citizens such as my Father3. Expose the OERC and ensure that they are legally required to inform ALL applicants that they do not have the jurisdiction or ability to overturn the laws put in place by OHIP above them so that people do not waste their time fighting to save a loved one that this committee cannot actually saveI understand that I am just one young woman, trying to take on a very complex legal system but I can assure you and everyone I speak to, that I will not stop until changes are made. I don't believe that there are enough young people such as myself fighting for what they believe in today. I think it is because fighting for what you want is a terribly difficult undertaking that involves a lot of patience, confidence and determination - thank goodness, these are all traits I am well equipped with.I truly hope that you can help my Dad find his way home before it is too late.Please visit my website @ www.fightfordad.com for the latest updates on my fight to save Dad's life.Thank you, Chala xo","March 6, 2016","$2,412","$500,000 "

Jody Black ,"Vancouver, BC","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","Hello my name is Joe Horrocks and I am a man on a mission to pressure the Canadian Federal Govt to introduce legislation to end the cruel and inhumane Canadian commercial seal hunt as well as promote The Global Citizen Charter IE:End extreme povertyFight inequality and injusticeProtect the planet  I am humbly asking for your support and seek to raise as much money as possiblefor my Journey for Change initiative. Every donation big or small is very much appreciated. All funds raised will be used to construct and build the Global Citizen Peace Ship and to facilitate the subsequent nation wide coast to coast Journey for Change Initiative. I propose to accomplish this mission by building The Global Citizen Peace Ship  and in July  of this year launching the Journey For Change initiative. The Global Citizen Peace Ship will be built as an elaborate and impressive version of a parade float that looks like a ship with a large mast with a massive peace symbol on the mast of the parade float ship. The ship will be built around a 24 passenger school bus that will be modified and constructed at my friends machine shop. I will then supply the ship with  Honda generators a large and powerful PA system plus a full drum kit miced to the PA system along with vocal mics and  Marshal amplifiers and speaker cabinets. The ship will be very diverse with attachable and changeable parts so that there will be the road legal version of the ship for travel between the Canadian cities we will visit and there will be the elaborate parade float version for when we pass through each major Canadian city. Once the Global Citizen Peace Ship is built my Band and I will drive the ship to st Johns Newfoundland to begin The Journey for Change initiative. The Journey will take us through the same cross country route originally charted by Canadian hero Terry Fox and his Marathon of Hope in 1980 and then subsequently completed by Steve Fonyo with his Journey for lives Marathon in 1985. The journey will start at the same spot as Terry Fox started near St Johns Newfoundland in July of this year and then finish in Victoria British Columbia in August or later depending on how much media and global attention the initiative can attract. The expectation for the mission is nothing short of historic and Epic and I believe the mission will absolutely succeed in serving as a lighting rod for Canadians coast to coast and the world community to have a unified voice to pressure Justin Trudeau and the Canadian federal govt to introduce legislation to end the Cruel and Inhumane Canadian commercial seal hunt massacre. As well as bring needed attention to the Global Citizen movement, its charter and mission. Before the June launch of the Journey for Change initiative I will issue a press release stating the missions purpose and agenda and I will at that time send a call out and invite every famous celebrity and performing artists of the world and most specifically Canadian celebrities and performing artists that are passionate enough for the missions potential success to come on board the Global Citizen Peace Ship in support and plug in their instruments and Rock out as we pass through each major Canadian city. Everyone will be invited and participation of well known celebrities and performing artist will certainly raise the level of impact and awareness for the missions success. As mentioned the Journey for Change initiative has a 2 tier agenda the first being to pressure the Canadian Federal Govt to introduce legislation to end the cruel and inhumane Canadian commercial seal hunt. and second to promote The Global Citizen movement and their charter. I will explain why I feel the urgency to take this aggressive action and why now is the time.    Why must the Canadian commercial seal hunt end ?Despite bans on the trade of seal products in many countries, Canada's commercial seal massacre -- the largest marine mammal hunt in the world -- still goes on each year. The hunt is inhumane and wasteful -- much of the demand is for luxury fur items, and most of the meat is thrown away.Canada is known to the world as a progressive, loving, great nation this barbaric madness is something that leaves a stain on the character of the Canadian people and many Canadians are vaguely aware or completely oblivious as to the extent of the inhumane atrocities being committed. But thankfully the word is getting out and public awareness is growing. I submit the commercial massacre of baby seals some no more than 3 weeks old beaten and sometimes skinned while they are still alive  is completely contradictory to what can be perceived to be in alignment with Canadian values? Due to global pressure the profits for Sealing are down considerably and the amount of sealers participating have gone from thousands to hundreds in recent years Thankfully it has become a disappearing industry that most nations around the world consider superfluous and barbaric.the tide is turning and as mentioned awareness is growing. The seal hunt is going to end and its going to end because of public and global pressure because its absurdly cruel.Why commercial sealing is cruelAs explained by the International Fund for Animal Welfare It is hard to portray just how cruel the business of commercial sealing is. The need to prioritize speed and profit, combined with an unpredictable environment makes it virtually impossible to ensure humane killing.Seal hunting in Canada .Each spring off the East Coast of Canada, hunters take their boats into dangerous waters or rush across moving ice pans in attempts to kill as many baby seals as possible in the short time available. Seal pups, most too young to escape, are either shot or hit with a spiked wooden club called a hakapik.Although the Canadian government compares the commercial seal hunt to the killing of farm animals, they have little in common. Unlike abattoirs, the commercial slaughter of seals takes place in an unpredictable, unmanageable environment where humane killing is impossible to achieve consistently.IFAW believes Canada’s commercial seal hunt can never be made acceptably humane. Here’s why:1                                                                                                                                                                                                         CCompetitive, commercial pressures make speed more important than humane killing. The seal hunt is effectively a race between sealers to collect as many skins as possible before the quota is reached. Sometimes as many as 150,000 seals have been killed in two days. Under such conditions, humane killing isn’t a priority and is rarely achieved.2                                                                                                                                                                                                         SSeal hunting involves unacceptably high wounding rates. When rifles are shot from moving boats at escaping seals or when the animals are chased across the ice pans with hunters swinging their hakapiks, it is unlikely a seal will be stunned effectively with a single blow or shot. Instead, animals are left wounded and terrified, lingering on the ice in pain, suffering and distress. Some seals are struck and lost.3                                                                                                                                                                                                         TThe current Marine Mammal Regulations do not set out requirements for humane killing of seals. Sanctioned hunting practices permit the most inhumane activities: live and conscious animals are impaled on steel hooks; seals can be shot at from moving boats and in open water; multiple animals can be shot before testing for unconsciousness, wounded seals may be left to suffer; and bleeding out is not required immediately after checking for unconsciousness. The requirements for humane slaughter are neither legislated nor practiced.4                                                                                                                                                                                                         EEffective monitoring and enforcement is impossible. Our over 40 years of seal hunt observation indicate that any regulations are impossible to enforce. Boats are widely dispersed over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, and hundreds, sometimes thousands, of boats take part. With only a few vessels available to enforce the hunt, officials face an impossible task.5                                                                                                                                                                                                         EEndemic disregard for the Regulations indicates the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is unwilling - and unable - to enforce any rules that might be in place. There is a clear conflict of interest in having the Department of Fisheries and Oceans responsible for enforcing the Regulations and at the same time defending the “humaneness” of the seal hunt.The evidence gathered by IFAW demonstrates that Canada’s commercial seal hunt is not conducted humanely and that monitoring and enforcement is all but impossible. Commercial sealing is inherently inhumane and seals - like all wild animals - should not be exploited for commercial gain.  I submit the commercial massacre of baby seals some no more than 3 weeks old beaten and sometimes skinned while they are still alive is completely contradictory to what can be perceived to be in alignment with Canadian values? 98 percent of the seals killed in the hunt are under 3 months old easy defenseless targets on the Ice. It’s time to step up and defend these majestic animals enough is enough it’s time to end this madness!  Its not a matter of if, its a matter of when and I am advocating the Canadian seals have suffered enough year after year the hunts demise is inevitable and needs to happen , so let the suffering and horror be brought to an end right now.I have started a petition at Change.org http://chng.it/rNDnYCc6bkMy goal is to collect 37 million signatures one signature for every man woman and child in Canada. I believe absolutely that  the weight of  overwhelming numbers on the petition combined with the public awareness and concern raised by the Journey for change. Will in turn force the Canadian federal govt to  introduce legislation to end the hunt.       I believe with a concentrated push from the majority of Canadians and members of the global community that also share the sentiment that these unspeakable horrors meted out on these defenceless majestic animals  must be stopped. The people collectively have the power and if the people organize and speak up the politicians will simply have no choice but to respect the wish of the people.what  is the Global Citizen movement and why is it  worthy of the support from my fellow Canadians and concerned citizens of the world.Global Citizen is a movement of engaged citizens who are using their collective voice to end extreme poverty by 2030, to fight inequality and injustice and to protect the planet. Through their mix of content and events, grassroots organizing and extensive reach through digital channels, they are building the world’s largest movement for social action. They organize massive global campaigns to amplify the actions of Global Citizens from around the world. I believe the Global Citizen movement to be a critical force for mobilizing the worlds population to taking the unified actions that absolutely must be aggressively implemented at this time as we draw closer to the point of no return where there won’t be a world left that is livable without intense hardship and suffering for all inhabitants of the earth both human and animals.  I’m proud to be Canadian and I love being Canadian also I believe we are all members of a Global community and I believe we sit at a historical crossroad, the ice caps are melting and species are being wiped out at an unprecedented and alarming rate. The evidence is clear. The Earth itself might go on just fine but we as a civilization are on the fast track to destruction and extinction through industrialized greed and a lack of caring and management of this earth that is our home. If we are going to turn the tide, the time for aggressive action to that end is now. This is the time in geological history when humans are the major force shaping the physical-chemical and biological properties of the planet. We are the force that is determining where the planet itself is going.  I believe the Global Citizen movement to be a powerful force towards ecological and social change as they gain more and more support from the global community.  I thank you for your consideration for support for my mission sincerely Joe Horrocks","February 16, 2019",$100,"$70,000 "

As the cost of higher education rises, I believe it is important to offer students every oppurtunity to educate themselves. I have designed this scholarship to help students reach their full potential as the leaders of tomorrow. If we all do a little, we can have a huge impact.Thank You,Nathanyl HomaLHS IB Senior","November 26, 2018",$400,$500

Fareed Khan ,"Gatineau, QC",Volunteer & Service,"Human Rights & Justice Support Fund (Fareed Khan)Support for social justice and human rights is one of my core values.  For years I have worked to support causes rooted in fundamental principles of justice, particularly where it concerns the vulnerable, the oppressed and the dispossessed.  I have done this without monetary compensation and dedicated thousands of volunteer hours to various social justice causes, especially where it concerns human rights and basic human dignity.  Some of the peoples and causes I have worked and spoken out on behalf of include: the Rohingya, the people of Kashmir and the Muslim minorities in India, Uyghurs in China, Indigenous Canadians, against hate, bigotry and racism in Canada and elsewhere, and in support of Palestinians.Sadly, it is my efforts to speak for the persecuted and oppressed people of Palestine that has made me a target of Israeli state sponsored intimidation.  As a result, my efforts to continue to be a voice in defence of human rights are now under threat.Added to this, a recent serious car accident in December 2019 has severely strained me financially and in terms of my health, and therefore required me to make this appeal in order that I may continue to do the work that is so important, and to pursue possible legal action against those who have targeted me.Last spring (2019) I challenged the brutality of the Israeli government in its treatment of Palestinians, and called for support for the BDS movement by Toronto Raptors fans.  As a result I have now become the target of a campaign of character assassination by the ""Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs"", an organization with links to the Israeli military. (https://canadadocs.org/tag/fareed-khan/)In response to a statement last spring by Toronto Raptors co-owner Larry Tanenbaum that the Raptors would visit Israel if they won the NBA championship  I called for all Raptors supporters (but particularly Muslim supporters) to launch a social media campaign to Raptors players to refuse to visit Israel in an effort to ""sportswash"" Israeli atrocities and brutality.   I shared this on multiple social media platforms that reached tens of thousands of people.  For this act of standing up for the long oppressed Palestinian people I am now on the radar of the Israeli government and its affiliated private organizations who make it their business to attack, delegitimize, and assassinate the character of anyone with a voice and platform who supports the Palestinian cause.Since my initial public call for supporting Palestinians and boycotting Israel I have received a number of online threats, as well as one death threat.However, I will not be silenced!All of the human rights and social justice work I do still needs to be done.  But now I have to do it under the shadow of an implicit threat by the very well-funded and Israel affiliated voices that justify oppression, brutality and murder of innocent Palestinians.Palestinians still need a voice to speak out for them.  The Rohingya, Uyghurs, Kashmiris, Indo-Muslims, and oppressed minorities in other parts of the world still need people speaking out and working on their behalf.  But the work that I do can only continue now if the threats against me are challenged through the generosity of supporters and donors.  This funding will cover the most basic of costs, which will primarily relate to legal consultations, transportation and communications expenses in support of social justice, human rights causes, and anti-racism causes.Below are links to a list of media interviews and public statements related to some of the above issues.While I have the energy, willingness and commitment to continue doing this work, none of it can continue without your generous support.Greater than the death of flesh is the death of hope and the death of dreams.  Those whose lives are engulfed in these perils need our understanding, help and support so that their lives once again have meaning and purpose.It is my goal that the work I do in support of social justice and human rights causes helps those facing and suffering from violent oppression and persecution at the hands of powerful forces who are destroying the hopes and dreams of tens of millions of peaceful people in different parts of the world.Sincerely,Fareed Khan**************CTV News ChannelTalking on CTV News Channel about the ""report card"" put out by the Rohingya Human Rights Network giving the Canadian

Andrew Chignell ,"York, ON",Community & Neighbors,"Organization statement:For over a decade Ontarians had to suffer under the aimless leadership of two liberal administrations. Thankfully the people of this province powerfully rebuked them last election, and brought in a government ready to cut waste and focus on the working class. From Northern Ontario down to it's southern tip, we are fed up with sunny ways without results. Now we must work hard to cement the momentum the conservative movement is generating across the country, straight in to the 2019 October Federal election.  The Liberal government has time and again implemented reckless policies that stymie the economic growth potential of this great nation. From allowing over regulated industry watchmen to shut down vital pipeline projects, to hapless negotiation tactics to deal with our biggest trading partner to the south. Justin Trudeau has made it clear that he prioritizes legal marijuana and lip service apologies over actual policy implementation. But this year the country will get on the right path, led by people who truly care about their communities. For too long the left have claimed to have the support of ordinary folks while stigmatizing any Conservative organization as being controlled by large corporations with special interests. However Keep Ontario Blue is run from the ground up by a dedicated team of every day middle class Canadians.Donations expenditures:Money donated will be used to create leaflets and posters with actual facts highlighting liberal government waste such as:-Canada's current account deficit (on a seasonally adjusted basis) widened by $0.7 billion in the first quarter to $17.3 billion due to overzealous program expansion-writing off corporate loan debt with no public transparency-failed trade relations with China, a potential huge global market without which Canada is forced to heavily bend to US terms-answers to many remaining question regarding the PMO's handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair-implementing an ill advised carbon tax that will throttle business investment at a time of global market uncertainty-failing to properly address the housing needs of Canadians from coast to coastAdditional funds will be used to organize events in smaller communities across the province such as  grass root outreach programs, neighbourhood discussion groups, baking competitions, and church sales. If enough funds are accumulated online discussion boards will also be created to connect Conservatives across the province and mobilize action. Together we will undo the mistakes of the last few years.    Additional inquiries:For information or if you wish to contact us to discuss a community collaboration project please email: keep.ontarioblue@gmail.com","August 12, 2019",$5,"$50,000 "

This project celebrates diversity, inspires creativity, and engages people across the country to be brave and daring in the name of cancer research. Fighting Cancer in CanadaCancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells. It can affect almost any part of the body, invade surrounding tissue, and spread to different sites. It is the leading cause of death in Canada, and each of Team #Nourished’s team members has a personal connection to cancer. Unfortunately, it’s hard to find someone who doesn’t. Devastatingly, nearly 1 in every 2 Canadians are diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. We’d like to help change all of that.How We’re HelpingTeam #Nourished is going all-in and will be colouring our hair to conquer cancer on May 24.

Jared Gotman ,"Hamilton, ON",Other,"I have long been a lurker on 4chan.org, somewhat a poster, and I think it is time for people to understand the real Truth behind how it works.Ever since Stormy Daniels came onto the scene, NXIVM followed suit; media chose to cover only one of those stories. But I firmly believe that NXIVM in it's entirety must come to the forefront of media. This is a cult that was involved in the trafficking of children, (via Rainbow Cultural Gardens) and the media has never covered it. In fact, the media has chosen to never cover much news about pedophiles, often when they are involved in the grotesque crime of raping children, or worse.Long have I wanted to speak out against such things, but I know I am merely one man. I am looking to set up a podcast with a close friend of mine (and/or simply aggregate data from 4chan, hopefully more intimate connections and timetables via discussion of topics)  where we can talk about these issues; many of them I would like to cover first and foremost are centered around NXIVM, Trudeau, Trump and perhaps Epstein.There is many very queer things around the NXIVM case. There is a single degree of seperation between Trump and NXIVM, because of his relationship with Stormy Daniels. There is also a small two degrees of seperation between Justin Trudeau and NXIVM., given his relationship with Stephen Bronfman. I would even wager Trudeau knows Sara or Clare Bronfman, just two of the women involved in NXIVM, thus making it a single degree of seperation. There is also the DTLA footage from last year when Military Vehicles were seen picking up a team with a duffel bag of some sort, and users on 4chan pinned it to a lawyer very close with the NXIVM case. One must wonder which side would do such a thing to secure information, and which side succeeded in it's goals.I have decided to write this out today, because I think it is time we the people start to draw attention to the vile acts of these people. If, for example we the people could convince Matthew Ricchiazzi, the publisher of The Buffalo Chronicle, to perhaps explain more indepth the way he really got information for the article that alleges Trudeau, as a teacher at West Point Grey Academy had sexual relations with a minor whom was at the time, under the age of consent which was coincidentally the age of 14 at the time.  (https://buffalochronicle.com/2019/10/19/trudeaus-west-grey-accusor-was-much-younger-than-first-thought/ )Is it not up to us as people to start calling out the pedophilic aristocrats that govern how we live? If not I, who else will dare to call these people what they are? Sick and twisted individuals, who think they are ""Hot Shit"". Should we never take notice of photos in which Justin Trudeau is seen with convicted pedophiles?  I hope to be able to cover these things not only with a close friend of mine, but with continued topics perhaps on 4chan regarding QAnon. Isn't it time we figure out what QAnon means? We the people are nothing if we do not work to share our information, and in a time when a potential bioweapon has been launched to cover the cabal, I think it's time we push back. If this has taught me anything, life could end in a matter of seconds, and we wouldn't be able to see it coming.Personally, I dare my government to come take me and torture me. You will reap what you sow. People will know the Truth. I only want to cover a few bills, and money is not really the object of what I am going for here, though larger donations could spur news to talk about these issues, and give me more grounds to work with a lot more data;and perhaps to work in a better format where I can place images myself.Though I hope I have piqued your interest. While this is the forefront of what I would like to talk about, should interest take off and my friend decides to join in, we will be talking about many different things regarding energy, consciousness and the works of many authors and intellectuals. But first and foremost, remember just how deep some of this could run, and how some people try to cover up or maybe get the drop on news stories...","February 2, 2020",0,$600 goal

Who , what , where , why and how Officially, I’m just a debt slave but I am a Human being having a spiritual experience with a medical emergency in a time when it’s incredibly popular to be dehumanizing. Sometimes fundraising events take a couple of years to garner high-level support, unfortunately time isn’t something that I have the privilege of  . God didn’t  give me a JOB with a broken hand  and you know Satan don’t   give you a credit card without one !  

Here in Canada under the present unemployment  legislation working class Canadians are  being denied a medical ei claim due to the dehumanizing regulations and penalties attached with regular claim  legislation , so what’s medical benefits for?! You would think it’s insurance that you pay into that keeps you off a soup line or worst the cold foundations that our cities are built on when you have and incident that leaves you unable to work and I know all  this because this is my third  time in my Entire life that I’ve had to apply for medical benefits  and it’s the first time I was denied, second time I was discriminated and I hoping this  time will be charm and my experiences can help change legislation to keep my country men Out of a Soup line in this increasing popularized dehumanizing pursuit of increased middle class homelessness I am in, with both feet and my one good hand ! 

We live in a time of high tech communication and there’s no excuse for never being properly informed or having your benefits put on hold for biased reasons from within the minds of our federal employees. hence ;  Attorney General of Canada v Kos, 2005 FCA 319. The key issue here was whether file notes by an insurance officer constituted a “decision” that triggered the time limit. The court ruled that it did not, in part because the notes were not communicated to the claimant . 

 If I’d  been properly informed in any of my inquiries over the last year either by mail , telephone or in person in any of the service Canada center's leading up to this frightening humiliating life changing experience I might not be panhandling for real change asking for spare change today, living in a RV , displaced , bruised , broken and permanently scared With no clue were my next hot meal is coming from after preparing and serving tens of thousands of hot meals in remote services to the working classes but here  I-am and I think our medical unemployment should be there not matter what, for all Canadians who get injured just as much as our government is there for American stock holders in an old pipeline , SNC Lavalin and the Highly affluent Irving family , don't you?! 

It’s in these times you find out who your friends, family , co workers  and society are while trying to understand why the government of Canada is middle aged white cat that doesn’t care for salad or the working classes .

 I’ve  enlisted  the assistant of Cathy McLeod  a Conservative MP in Kamloops BC and I’m eagerly awaiting to plant my feet and connect the dots with Bob Zimer Conservative MP who has had his office intervene 3 times with unemployment benefits . I have 5 more Weeks before my  hand is healed and with your help and my determination we can make real changes with a party that promises to be the People’s representation while Justin Trudeau is campaigning for a better Canada and  forgiving 7.4 million in  loans ?! 

In closing I am full of hope for what we can accomplish by working together and alongside our Newly sworn in MPs 

We are the change and With great appreciation I thank you for your time , support and donations.

Rights vs freedoms is a difficult balancing act. It involves societies figuring out where one person’s freedoms end and another person’s rights begin; and likewise, vice versa- where one person’s rights end and another person’s freedoms begin.It’s not an easy question to answer, but it seems like Western nations are becoming more and more unbalanced towards increasingly subjective rights- such as the right not to be offended (which should not be a right in a lot of cases given how subjective offenses are).The most recent example in Canada comes from a city in Alberta named St. Albert. City officials handed out a 2 week, no pay suspension to their recently hired fire chief because 3 years ago (before he was even hired with the city) he dressed up as an artist he respects and admires- Lenny Kravitz. In today’s increasingly far left and politically correct landscape this was apparently a grievous affront to the dignity of minorities everywhere- despite the fact that dressing up as a real individual is not the same as dressing up in blackface (which involves simply darkening one’s skin color, without trying to be anyone specific, and which also has a racist history in its origins). This is also despite the fact that African Americans and people of color are not a monolith of ideology and whether one is offended by such things is a varying matter. For example, one of the people of color who attended the Arabian themed Halloween party where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dressed up in black face years ago stated “He wasn’t trying to demean anybody who was a person of color, and from what I can recall from that function, it never came across as that, not at all,” he said recently. “I mean, I didn’t even think twice of it. It was a good party. We had fun.” In this case, Mr. Kravitz obviously was not even aware of Mr. Gretzinger having done so and, as a public figure, it's doubtful Bernd is the first person to have ever done so. He is, however, the first person to be made an example of through suspension and financial penalty. While he did apologize and admit he felt the costume was racially insensitive, As such, the purpose of this Gofund Me page is twofold. First and foremost it exists to try and recoup the money that Mr. Gretzinger was unfairly withheld by the city he works for and to which has dedicated decades of his life to (by working for and saving individuals of all race). The second is- by recouping that money- to send a message to the city that people are not okay with far left ideologies being illegally enacted against its citizens without legal pathways. There is nothing in the Charter of Rights of Freedoms dictating that private Canadian citizens cannot dress up a certain way, even if it offends a certain people. Likewise, as was stated earlier, this event occurred “years” before Mr. Gretzinger was even hired as fire chief. Whether one agrees or disagrees with dressing up as a real person of a different race, to punish him publicly and financially even after he had apologized was not only wrong, but an overreaction of epic proportion that proves political correctness is becoming worse and worse. 

This needs to stop. It is not healthy for individuals to be offended by things that they don’t need to be offended by and it is obviously not healthy for the people they choose to target their irrational offense against (such as Mr. Gretzinger). As such, if you agree that political correctness is out of control, and you want to say thank you to Mr. Gretzinger for all his years of service as a fireman, you can feel free to donate whatever amount you feel is appropriate. As stated, all of the money raised here will go to recouping the money withheld from him and his family. If you have no money to donate, but would like to share the page, please feel free to do so instead. Thank you.

This is whyAfter years of study and delay, The decade-long saga over the Keystone XL pipeline, which would stretch nearly 1,200 miles from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Neb., has been full of legal twists.The Keystone XL, was first proposed in 2008 under President George W. Bush, would begin in Alberta and go to Nebraska, where it would join with an existing pipeline to shuttle more than 800,000 barrels a day of crude to terminals on the Gulf Coast.Envisioned in 2008 as a way to connect Canada’s oil sands fields with Gulf Coast refineries, the project has died and been resurrected more than once.In 2015, on the eve of the international climate talks in Paris,The Obama administration announced it was halting construction on the remainder of the Keystone XL pipeline, arguing approval would compromise America’s effort to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

Jay Lumiere ,"Halifax, NS",Other,"“Join us in our fight to write a new ending to an old story – Agent Orange.”I am a Canadian army veteran who was exposed to toxic chemicals in a formulation called “Agent Orange” during secret aerial spraying operations conducted at Camp Gagetown, New Brunswick, Canada between 1964 and 1967.  Like many of my army buddies, I suffer a number of diseases attributed to exposure to these deadly toxins - ischemic heart disease, lung cancer and metastatic cancer of the spine. The deadly effects of Agent Orange on foliage and humans have been known since the 1950s “Malayan Emergency”. In fact, the spraying of Agent Orange on the jungle and enemy soldiers would otherwise meet the definition of chemical warfare and be punishable as a war crime. For that reason, and because the rubber and tin plantation owners would not be paid out by insurance companies, the war in Malaya (now Malaysia) was declared an “emergency” and not a war. This was done so that Britain could not be punished for using chemical warfare to defoliate the Malayan jungle, under which communist troops lived. America refused to use Agent Orange until they could find a strict legal definition, ultimately absolving them of what would otherwise be a war crime.  In the end, Britain provided a politically acceptable definition and America found a friendly country, Canada, in which to test their chemicals.The use of toxic chemicals (dioxins) on Canadian troops is a story the Government of Canada wishes to bury as they spend millions of dollars fighting veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and who claim compensation for their years of pain and suffering since the 1960’s.  I have stage 4 cancer, and I do not have much time left.  I need to reach as many people as possible, to inform them of the facts and to tell my story. The Government of Canada and Veterans Affairs Canada, continuously deny the veterans claims using quasi-judicial, obstructive, and lengthy proceedings that are essentially an attempt to outlast elderly and infirm veterans until there are none left to complain. There are fewer than half of us remaining so there is great urgency in getting this information out to the Canadian public. Veterans are the men and women who, by offering their lives in times of conflict, guarantee freedom for all Canadians. And yet Veterans Affairs Canada continues to drag its feet with lies, years of red tape, misconceptions and broken promises. New generations of men and women joining the military services are returning from combat zones inflicted with physical and psychological wounds only to discover that they must fight their own country for benefits coverage. We Agent Orange victims have also been cast aside and the millions of dollars voted to be spent on our plight have been returned to government coffers unspent. What of the young men and women of today who need support in dealing with a broken mind or body? I propose to prove that these deceptions and delays are carried out purposefully, under the coat of Arms of Canada and our proud Canadian flag. From the Minister of Defense and the Minister of Veterans Affairs, down to the individuals who adjudicate veterans files, there could not be a more unethical federal department in this country. The veterans’ last battle is being fought right here, in our own country against our own government. If one needs proof of this, one needs only to replay the Prime Minister’s own words. When confronted by a veteran during a Town Hall in Edmonton about the ongoing dispute, Justin Trudeau said: “Why are we still fighting against certain veterans’ groups in court? They are asking for more than we can give right now”. What of the unspent $143 million?  What of the $37 million in legal fees spent fighting veterans?Funds are needed urgently, now. It is my greatest hope that together, we can form a group that will ensure, and continue to ensure after I am gone, that our veterans are taken care of. The Prime Minister continues to appoint new Ministers of Veterans Affairs in a revolving door of incompetence - each new minister blaming the last government - never resolving the problem of injured and ill veterans of yesterday and today.  The passing of time, age and pain mean nothing to them.  The architects of the “compassionate plan”, which was never meant to work, are still out there ready to kick the “Agent Orange File” into the tall grass of the next election cycle. My mission is to build a strong team to continue to raise funds for veterans’ legal costs, provide information and awareness to potential recruits, and work toward the common goal of supporting veterans who have been injured in the line of duty. I do not believe the Ombudsman can separate this clear obligation from his duty to be respectful to the current Veterans Affairs Canada officials, as he is required to report directly to the Minister of Veterans Affairs.I am proposing a new name and motto for this mission: Agent Orange Rangers - ""Fighting for Veterans’ Rights"". I envision a Canadian-themed, wounded warrior crest, and we will vote against a government that fights its own veterans. 'Image design courtesy of Keith Thompson'.Knowing I am dying is very empowering. It allows me to tell my story, and fills me with the greatest energy to undertake this mission, for as long as I can. In short, I will travel the length and breadth of this great country. I will connect with the representatives of our ally countries who sent their soldiers to train in Camp Gagetown. I will visit every university, Legion, organization and gathering that will permit me the time and space to tell my story. We will gather the facts from Vietnamese hospitals where second and third generation children languish with birth defects attributed to Agent Orange. We will push to continue our mission by establishing a physical location for the veterans to gather, record their stories and provide a source of renewed hope, help, and potential legal expertise, and will raise the funds required to do so. We will refresh the Agent Orange story. We will cause the floodgates to open and we will keep them open until the problem is resolved. I will undertake the first part of this GoFundMe® project, which will consist of the following actions:  1.           A scan of my entire file will be made available to the public as a baseline information package;2.           Transcribed audiotapes of my hearings will be made available to the public for the same purpose;3.             The completion of a booklet focusing on the short history of Agent Orange relative to our veterans;4.           Updated facts related to the suffering of foreign forces who trained at Camp Gagetown and a status report on the resolution sought by those same forces will be made accessible to the public; 5.           Current information that illustrates the collateral damage caused by the spraying of Agent Orange will be compiled and exposed;6.           The creation of a veterans’ advocacy group comprised of individuals and other interested entities, coming together with the ultimate goal of establishing a not-for-profit organization that will act as an information resource for veterans (wounded or other) and any other person or organization interested in the cause.Moving forward, the needs of the mission are urgent and great. We need funds for:1.          Publishing a booklet with truthful historical facts about Agent Orange and the lies told in their place;2.           Badges, pins and clothing to identify our cause and our affiliations;3.            A website containing information about Agent Orange and reference links to court cases associated with the   toxic chemicals; 4.            Travel, in order to maintain a continuity of purpose and cohesion among our supporters nationally;5.            The rental of office space for official mission headquarters (after the not-for-profit has been created and fundraising is successful), providing information to the public and a home base for the veterans to check in for updated information and assistance.6.            The creation of a monument, located in a public space in Ottawa, honoring the veterans who have been affected by Agent Orange.We will accept funds through this site and eventually through a website that we will establish, and we will distribute those funds according to the needs of the mission and its goal of assisting the Canadian victims of exposure to Agent Orange. These men and women are as much wounded warriors as other injured veterans with whom we share a common interest, namely, being treated fairly in return for our sacrifice. We are a veteran’s advocacy group in official opposition to the deceitful treatment of Canadian veterans by our own government. There are very few Agent Orange ‘Rangers’ left, but with your help our fight will continue long after we are gone. Your generosity will allow us to advocate for veteran’s benefits and rights in Canada, changing the face of Veterans Affairs as we know it.                                                      Agent Orange Rangers - ""Fighting for Veterans’ Rights""Disclaimer: We are not a shelter for veterans and we do not foresee the provision of this service in the future. We will have information available for any veteran needing a place to rest their head.","June 11, 2019",0,"$48,000 goal"
Kevin Scanlon ,"Winnipeg, MB",Community & Neighbors,"I expect this to be an enormous learning experience because I don’t believe I completely understand the entire scope of the issues involved, not even close.  I’ve lived in many different communities in Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia.  My experience with Aboriginal people has varied tremendously in each province, from close friendships and business relationships to being the target of outright racism and disrespect.  Finding the positive in situations in something I try to do every day, for instance, I think professional sports teams who take names like the Blackhawks, Redskins, Eskimos, Braves ext. do so because the team wants to portray pride and strength, rather than something racist or degrading.  There is no denying, what has happened to Aboriginal people in the past is outrageous.  I think there are valuable lessons to be learned by studying our mistakes and the result.  What I see is a people who’s way of life was torn away from them, and with it their sense of pride.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made many apologies, there is a place for that and it’s important to acknowledge…I don’t want to do that here, I want to look forward.   The idea here is funds raised will go to communities in need, one community at a time.  The goal will be to identify opportunities for growth and prosperity for the community, then help with training members in the community to make that growth and prosper as a whole. Part of this will be lobbying the government for policy change as needed and to match contributions.  I am a hunter, I would think some of these communities could benefit from hunting.  Maybe the community could be issued a certain number of Big Game Tags that they could in turn sell to visiting hunters who will need a place to stay and a guide.  This would promote a conservation style attitude in the community because if there are more animals, there would be more Tags issued.  A simple idea that won't work everywhere, all communities will have different challenges. Communities will be chosen on a case by case basis.  You are encouraged to write telling your communities story and any specific ideas of ways your community could prosper with a little help.  Again the idea is not to give a cash hand out but to build the community through identifying opportunities, training and providing some building materials/supplies. Professionals and trades people willing to contribute their skills and knowledge are also encouraged to make contact.","June 8, 2019",0,"$100,000 goal"

Quiggin Report` ,"East York, ON",Other,"Operation: Kill Switch asks why a federally registered taxpayer subsidized charitable organization, with alleged links to extremism, still has charitable status?   Why does the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and many of his caucus members have such strong ties to these types of organizations? Military veteran and intelligence expert, Tom Quiggin, has been sharing technical intelligence analysis on this issue and is now targeted in a frivolous multi-million-dollar lawfare lawsuit to try to silence him. Should taxpayer-funded charities be allowed to target our military veterans with your money? -> Help us protect this military veteran who continues to fight to keep our society (and us) safe from growing extremism.-> Help us expose these organizations and their members for their alleged nefarious connections to extremism by supporting our campaign now.Speak up and act while you still can. Your donations and support will help us fight back.BACKGROUNDLast year, Tom Quiggin, an ex-military intelligence and counter-terrorism expert launched a podcast to share his 30 years of experience in intelligence gathering and analysis on the current threats our society is facing.Tom Quiggin is a court qualified expert on terrorism (criminal court and Federal Court) and “intelligence collection and evidence” (Federal Court). Tom has testified on multiple occasions to Senate and the House of Commons Committees as well as a Royal Commission (Air India Inquiry 2007). He has also provided testimony to the Special Senate Committee on Anti-terrorism (2010).  A former Senior Fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he has 30 plus years of practical intelligence experience in a variety of positions including the: - Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Bank of Canada, - Canadian Armed Forces- United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia- Citizenship and Immigration Canada (War Crimes) - International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (The Hague)- Privy Council Office of Canada. - Arms control inspector for the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the Vienna Document. For the past several years Tom Quiggin has been researching the growth of extremism in western nations engaged in a well financed campaign of entryism, fueled by numerous front groups tracing back to the The Muslim Brotherhood Islamist Terrorist network.  Due to the vast amounts of financial support from foreign actors, mainstream media often refuses to report on these and related topics. They fear reprisal or being targeted by lawfare / harassment lawsuits, designed exclusively to cause ongoing financial damages through exorbitant legal fees charged to any defendant. This is the tactic being used now against Tom Quiggin, Raheel Raza of Muslims Facing Tomorrow, and Tahir Gora (co-authors of the book Submission) for filing an official complaint to Canada’s federal police and intelligence agency, The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Canadian Security and Intelligence Agency (CSIS) is also believe to be surveilling similar operations.  In 2015 a federally registered organization was identified as a Muslim Brotherhood front group in Senate Testimony in Canada. Since then, Tom Quiggin has been exposing the facts of its relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas both listed terrorist organizations by a variety of foreign military and  intelligence agencies. This organization has now launched a retaliatory multi-million dollar lawfare harassment lawsuit accusing Tom Quiggin and six other entities of allegedly running a “campaign of defamation”. Although many of the documents sighted in the RCMP complaint are Government of Canada sources, the organization has decided that these are irrelevant and is desperately trying to keep Tom Quiggin’s body of work on this topic hidden from public consumption.   This is an aggressive scare tactic aiming to force us to abandon our platforms, to censor documented facts and obfuscate the responsibility of the actors involved.We will not back down. They have made this a public legal battle where our irrefutable evidence will expose them to public scrutiny. But we desperately need your support. Operation: Kill Switch is how we do this. We need your help to bring the evidence to trial and take this organization down, so if you support this cause, please help us by contributing to the campaign today.OPERATION: KILL SWITCH The federally registered charity, Islamic Relief Canada, is politically connected to the Liberal Party of Canada, influential in terms of policy and directly linked to Islamic Relief Worldwide. (Islamic Relief Worldwide has been listed as a terrorist funding operation by The United Arab Emirates). Much of our evidence has been provided by government documents and or Islamic Relief Canada’s own documentation, but winning the case and pushing back at this  organizations aggressive bullying tactic, cannot be taken lightly. They have considerable financial resources and support from numerous other powerful organizations. In addition, since the Trudeau government was elected, the organisation in question, are now receiving funding directly from the government of Canada to combat “islamophobia”. This will become relevant at a later date. To document and prove the connections, and to follow the money trail, requires a lot of preparation, an organized and strategic response, and financial resources. This is Operation: Kill Switch - A coordinated effort to defend our rights and freedoms, to question and debate the activities of this group and others like it, and deter them from accessing taxpayer money to finance extremist activities abroad.If you believe in this cause as much as we do, please help us and donate to the campaign now.PREPARATION HAS BEGUNThe victims being targeted in this harassment suit have sought legal council to assess the campaign against them.  Based on initial consultations and research, we have started taking action to prepare our response and a statement of defence - a public document highlighting much of our evidence, which has now been filed with the superior court.  Operation Kill Switch is already very much underway:- A team of researchers with expertise in analysis, from various countries and backgrounds, is collecting more and more evidence- Tom Quiggin is working with other specialists in his network, to build on the evidence in the initial statement of defence and ensure the are filed, and on the public record.- Council retained by Tom Quiggin are experienced in the field of defamation and lawfare suits targeting individuals(What is lawfare? Lawfare is a form of war consisting of the use of the legal system against an enemy, such as by damaging or delegitimizing them, tying up their time or winning a public relations victory. The term is a portmanteau of the words law and warfare.  Lawfare is the use or misuse of the law to silence critics or drive them into submission rather than using other means such as civil discourse or discussion. Islamist groups in North America regularly use well-funded lawfare cases to silence or frighten those who expose their extremist beliefs.)- Community groups and leaders have been contacted to address questions about nefarious entities working within the plaintiff organization, allegedly making statements that could be considered hate speech.  For example, Fathima Bahatta executive member of Islamic Relief has been recorded making statements like “the Jews are the enemies of Islam” and long live the antifada [Holly war against Jews.] We have requested an investigation into hate speech comments demanding her resignation.- Operation Kill Switch will also lead a parallel investigation and inquiry asking how an organization with potentially questionable and/or indirect ties to extremism could still be a federally registered charity under Canadian and international law.- Aid concerned advocacy groups working to fight against extremism, hate speech and groups fighting anti-semitism, to highlight such egregious views and demand the immediate resignation of these individuals. WHO IS INVOLVED?The following people are targeted in the proceedings:TOM QUIGGIN Tom Quiggin is a federal and criminal court-qualified terrorism expert whose expertise on the “the reliability of intelligence as evidence” has been recognized by the Federal and Criminal Court of Canada, where his testimony has been entered as evidence on multiple occasions. Quiggin has conducted ground-breaking work to expose facts that are extremely important not only to Canadians but to the international community, as we deal with a global Islamist insurgency which few people are brave enough to address in public forums for fear of targeting by extremists aligned with the islamist cause. This body of evidence is opening avenues for major discussion and debate desperately needed in our society consumed by political correctness, politicking, and the shameful rise of the muzzling of freedom of speech under the banner of Islamophobia. There are opinions and there are facts; Quiggin does not engage in uninformed speculation. There is at least one group, however, attempting to use a tactic called libel chill, using our very own legal system against us, to silence voices like Tom Quiggin purporting that he has used opinion to run a “campaign of defamation”. Quiggin’s expertise has not gone unnoticed and throughout his career, he has been called upon by numerous government entities and specialist organizations to offer his expert advice to their leaders. Today Tom hosts his own podcast to share his intelligence insight with a wider audience, and has a regular spot on National Post Radio and Sirius XM, in his weekly talk with Anthony Fury, host of Canada Talks (channel 167).  Tom is also a frequent guest on syndicated radio programs such as The Roy Green Show with veteran journalist Roy Green, Charles Adler Tonight, Global News Radio with Award Winning Journalist Alex Pierson, Former political leader turned radio journalist Danielle Smith, and numerous alternative media sources, YouTube Channels, podcasts and other forums. RAHEEL RAZARaheel Raza is a member of the Clarion Project Advisory Board and President of the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow.

In a presentation to Members of Parliament and international diplomats at the House of Commons in Canada, Raza received a standing ovation for her speech called, “Celebrating our Differences.”Raheel has received many awards for her work building bridges of understanding, including the City of Toronto’s Constance Hamilton award for working towards the equitable treatment of women. She also received the Senate of Canada 150 medal in honour of her advocacy. Senator Frum, speaking at the ceremony, cited Raza’s commitment to liberty and equity and thanked her for “relentless advocacy for human rights, particularly the rights of vulnerable girls and women living under Sharia law”.In June 2006, Raheel was invited to meet Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada following which she also had the honour to meet with Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada. Yet, in subsequent years, Canadian leaders have been less honouring of her accomplishments. While politicians are glad to pose for photo ops with more radical voices, Raza said, “a Muslim woman who has been warning about the dangers of radicalization encroaching on the corridors of every institution in this country is kept away like a pariah.”TAHIR GORAGora is a prominent novelist, poet, journalist, editor, translator and publisher with over 30 years of experience in the industry.

Jerry Martin ,"Whitewood, SK",Non-Profits & Charities,"Every single person of a certain age in this country has shared one common experience. We have needed to purchase medicine for ourselves, or someone we care for. Simple access to safe medicine is the difference between a painful night and easy dreams.Who am I? And why support this cause?My name is Jerry Martin and I dedicated the last 4 years to saving and bettering lives with cannabis medicine. I've donated over $150,000 of my former shop's profits back to the local community, and others in need worldwide. Now I need your help.On Tues Nov 8th 2016, after 4 years of helping my community with easy access to safe medicine, the Broadview police seized the contents of my cannabis dispensary, and everything I personally own. I was arrested and indited on 7 offences resulting in the closure of my business, Martin Medical Services MMS Corp.However, there's hope.I have retained lawyer Paul Lewin to fight a constitutional challenge on all our behalf. In most cases, in order to make changes to law, and challenge a constitutional matter, one must first give up their freedoms and rights by being arrested. Because I was arrested, I can challenge the entire law.

Karissa John ,"Fort Erie, ON",Education & Learning,"“Education is the most powerful weapon you can give somebody” – Nelson Mandela She:kon,  My name is Karissa John and I am Mohawk of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, Six Nations. I have applied to the Native American & Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA) Conference in Hawaii, and was successfully selected to present on my paper titled “‘Haudenosaunee Nation: Restricted & Confined, Fight for Justice, ‘Fight the Line’”. I am seeking communal support and any financial endorsements to help cover the costs of travel and accommodations. I have provided a brief introduction of who I am, and how I came to be on this journey of academia and justice for the Haudenosaunee. As a Mohawk woman, I do not identify as Canadian or American. My people of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, who inhabited this land for thousands and thousands of years before contact, did not have boundaries, did not have borders - Canada and the United States is a construction. Being born in Buffalo NY and raised in Fort Erie ON, aided in my confusion early on while negotiating my identity. I never felt that I belonged to a particular country, rather I maintain that I am Onkwehón:we of Turtle Island. The ambiguity of this resiliency is compelling though; for on the one hand, I am resisting the allure of conforming to an imposed settler colonial identity, an identity that if embraced, would enable me to see the world outside Turtle Island and would make travel easier and more accessible. While on the other hand, to “refuse the gift” (of settler citizenship) aids in the assertion of Haudenosaunee sovereignty; however, this resistance means that I am restricted and confined to Turtle Island (North America). Fortunately though, I am privileged to be Mohawk of Six Nations, at least I can continue to travel between Canada and the United States (by land). Unjustifiably, for those of the Haudenosaunee Nations situated on the southern side of the imaginary line (between Canada and the U.S.A), some are confined only to the United States. It is this grave violation of our inherent rights as the original peoples that motivated me to go back to school so I can learn the history of these lands and understand the processes which sustain the ongoing colonization of my people by the way of colonial divide and conquer strategies. To this end, I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at York University, double majoring in Interdisciplinary Social Science and Multicultural and Indigenous Studies.Despite my recent accomplishments, education and I had quite the obscure relationship growing up. I went from being valedictorian of my grade 8 class, honour roll and student athlete in grade 10, to acquiring an anti-education attitude by eleventh grade. While working in Six Nations on weekends, I read a story of a priest going across Canada “digging up dirt” on the history of church and federally sanctioned residential schools. This evoked me to begin doing my own research about the history of Canada - which to even consider one has to look at the history of “Canada's” original peoples. Needless to say, I didn't like what I found. The atrocities that were committed against innocent people – men, women and children, especially children – by these 'Holy' people, blew my mind. It lead me to a new awareness and I began to think critically of the world around me. It was then, about eleventh grade, so 16/17 years old, that I hit a huge identity crisis. This new 'awakening' proved to be both a blessing and a curse.  A blessing because it had awakened my mind to truths and realities, it taught me to be a critical thinker and to question everything. A curse because these realities are dark, sad, and they brought on a type of depression, an isolation. All those years that I felt strong, and thought I was immune to the destructive cycle, immune to the dangerous affects that alcohol has on my people, my family - I was wrong. The deep emotions I was feeling had brought back bad memories of my childhood, things that I worked so hard to block out.  So there I went into the dark, empty abyss, falling down the road to self-destruction, that bottomless pit that feeds off the hurt and pain of my people.  I wasn't living, I wasn't alive; I was empty and numb. The wrath of the poison clings so strong to those in pain and suffering, it is the cycle, the endless, destructive cycle.After four years of heavy drinking I endured hard time after hard time – all lessons trying to get me to stop and live my true purpose. Despite near death experiences and legal problems, it wasn’t until a terrible car crash [which I had no business surviving] that I finally hit rock bottom. Now when you hit rock bottom there are only two options - life or death - you either stay there, or you climb. When I hit rock bottom five years ago, I chose life, I chose to climb. I call this defining moment in my life my ‘spiritual awakening’ because it rocked my life so hard that I had nothing left but to turn my life to Creator and pray that he got me to it and he will get me through it. I chose sobriety and to spend the rest of my days devoted to finding my life purpose and living in accordance with principles of love, peace and respect. And Creator has been so good to me; I understand now that all of those terrible experiences were lessons I needed to learn so I can be in a position to help my people for the better. So I can understand firsthand what youth are going through and I can use my voice, use my new found strength and help them. Therefore, I decided in order to do that I needed to go back to school. Knowing that my grades weren’t the greatest my last couple years of school I asked the Universe/Creator for a program I can take that can somehow get me to University without having to go to college first. Almost as soon as I put it out there, it came and I enrolled in York’s Women’s Bridging Program January of 2012, finished in April, and walked into York University that fall. I am finding, the more I learn of my ancestors and the various implications of colonization, the more I understand my people, my family and myself. This understanding brings a tremendous amount of healing and I know now why they say that ‘knowledge is power’ and I’d add, that it sets you free.Years ago I made a promise to my best friends that I was going to do something to correct the injustice that is colonial powers dividing Haudenosaunee, dividing us. And when I was presented with flexibility in my History of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada course to write a research paper of my interest, I jumped at the opportunity to explore border crossing issues as they pertain to Haudenosaunee specifically. Through tears of utter frustration and feeling so disheartened by this gross misconduct of justice in the 21st century, my heart ached throughout the process, yet I worked through it and put my heart and soul into the research and writing hoping to do some justice to a very unjust situation. Ultimately, my professor nominated the paper for a history award and later in April 2015 I was asked to present it at the Critical Ethnic Studies Association (CESA) conference which took place at York. A friend had then encouraged me to submit an abstract to the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA) conference taking place May 18-21st at the University of Hawaii. Originally I had missed the November 1st deadline to apply and feeling bummed out, on November 2nd I visited the website and was so happy to find the deadline was extended to November 4th – my 5th year anniversary of sobriety. And with the support of friends I met at CESA, I submitted my abstract. On the morning of December 29th I woke up to messages of “check your email” and sure enough my paper, “Haudenosaunee Nation, Restricted and Confined, Fight for Justice, ‘Fight the Line’” was accepted!I don’t believe in coincidences and I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. After all, the dark days have taught me to have faith and trust the process – whatever is meant to be will be. And I have all the faith in the world that I am meant to take this paper to this conference and see where it will go from there. My hopes for this paper is to serve not only as a resource on the history of border crossing issues but as a call to action. It is an invitation to the Haudenosaunee to learn of this history and to organize our collective efforts, our voice, to demand redress for this ongoing colonial abuse. To call on Canada’s newly elected Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, to follow through on his “Nation-to-Nation” promises and see to it that the Jay Treaty is ratified in Canadian legislation – as it should be. Unfortunately, there isn’t any funding at York for undergraduate students to attend conferences and the other options I have explored (i.e., Dreamcatcher Fund) do not cover individual trips. Furthermore, my refusal to get a settler passport requires me to travel out of Buffalo NY (which is double the cost of flights leaving Toronto and the U.S dollar is really high right now). This is why I am hoping to raise enough funds to atleast cover the travel portion of my trip. Because the costs of flights raise as the days go by, time is of the essence. As a student, I do not have the extra funds at the moment to book a flight to Hawaii so I greatly appreciate any support I get! The amount of encouragement and support that I receive by loved ones and friends is already generous and incredibly humbling. It truly means so much to me knowing that I have a whole community behind me and the work that I do and intend to continue doing. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for all your love, support and guidance as I embark on this journey of picking up the torch of my ancestor Deskaheh Levi General who took the fight to the United Nations and urged the Haudenosaunee to continue to “fight the line” – continue the fight for Haudenosaunee rights to cross the border. I feel that they (my ancestors) are still doing their work, through me. And in that way, we are always connected and the work of my great-great-great uncle Deskaheh is not forgotten, but lives on in me.Nia:wen Kowa, Karissa","January 22, 2016","$2,090","$2,000 "
Wellington Kasha Sears ,,Travel & Adventure,"My name Wellington Sears I am a Volunteer Fire fighter with ""Caribbean Fire and Rescue Benevolent"" ,a small business owner, Member of my islands local clean up committee, as well as an activist and adventurer. Many like myself living in the Bahamas were devastated to hear the news about the Amazons massive and historical fire. Many like myself wanted to offer our assistance and to give aid to those affected by such a devastating impact to our world and their country. I did not want to be the person troubled by something and wanting to do something about it, but like many others do, sit at home and do nothing at all. Watching the news and seeing people and even celebrities doing what they can in order to save the lungs of our planet known as ""the Amazon rainforest"" has inspired me towards making steps to do what I can in order to offer assistance. The people of the Bahamas sympathise with the people and animals of the Amazon as we too deal with impacts to our environment constantly due to development, climate change , and natural disasters like the category 5 hurricane ""Dorian"" that just recently devastated and destroyed many of our family islands like Abaco and Grand Bahama in the Bahamas Sep1-3 2019. We see the need for members of our community coming together to do what we can to protect our environment and rebuild where its needed. We see the need to reach out and help others around the world attempting to do the same, by creating a community all around the world that is always willing and always able to help.Make a donation to this campaign and help me and my team go to the amazon to assist the situation  and offer hands on as well as financial assistance to those in need. The plan is to train as many in CPR and fire and safety 101, clean up areas most devastated by the fire, rebuild homes and public areas as well as indigenous communities, provide food, water, and medical aid where needed, establish a long lasting relation with all charities and people involved. Funds raised will be used for plane tickets, Living accommodations, shipping of goods, services, transportation, photograph/videos, clean up initiative, fire fighting equipment, first responder training, training equipment, food & water, medical supplies, building supplies, financial aid etc.... The Amazon rainforest has been on fire for the past month, and Brazil has declared a state of emergency in the region. The fires are destroying the homes of indigenous tribes and threatening millions of animal species. One tribal chief described the halting response of Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, regarding the fires, along with his support for deforestation, as a form of genocide CBS News reported Thursday. The number of fires in Brazil this year is the highest on record since 2013 and is up by 85% from last year alone, CNN reported. So far this year, more than 80,000 fires in the country have been detected by Brazil's space research center, INPE. There are so many fires burning right now, that smoke is visible from space. European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano captured images of smoke from the International Space Station on Monday. Parmitano said the haze is so widespread, it resembles clouds in some of the photos.Attention to the fires surged worldwide in mid-August when social media users rallied around several trending hashtags. People around the globe also took to the streets in protest, demanding action to stop the fires. Eventually, foreign leaders began to speak out on social media and develop a plan to help put out the fires. Here's everything we know about the ongoing fires in the Amazon and multiple ways you can help. What caused the fires?While the Amazon rainforest is typically wet and humid, July and August -- the onset of the dry season -- are the region's driest months, with ""activity"" peaking by early September and stopping by mid-November, according to NASA. Fire is often used to clear out the land for farming or ranching. For that reason, the vast majority of the fires can be attributed to humans, Christian Poirier, program director of the nonprofit Amazon Watch, told CNN. Without providing evidence, Bolsonaro suggested the fires were set by nongovernmental organizations in retaliation to funding cuts. He later said he never accused them, according to the BBC. What's the connection to climate change?In a release on Aug. 22, Greenpeace said forest fires and climate change operate in a vicious circle. As the number of fires increase, greenhouse gas emissions do too. This makes the planet's overall temperature rise, the organization said. As the temperature increases, extreme weather events like major droughts happen more often. ""In addition to increasing emissions, deforestation contributes directly to a change in rainfall patterns in the affected region, extending the length of the dry season, further affecting forests, biodiversity, agriculture and human health,"" Greenpeace said in the release. On Aug. 23, NASA released an AIRS Map showing the carbon monoxide associated with the fires in Brazil between Aug. 8 and Aug. 22. The animated map shows a carbon monoxide plume bloom in the northwest Amazon region, move south and east, and then toward San Paolo. What areas are affected?The fires have spread to Bolivia and Paraguay, according to a report from Telesur on Wednesday. The smoke can be felt in Uruguay and Argentina. Previously, satellite images showed fires in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Rondonia, Para and Mato Grosso. The state of Amazonas is most affected, according to Euronews. Effects of damage to the Amazon go far beyond Brazil and its neighbors. The area's rainforest generates more than 20% of the world's oxygen and is home to 10% of the world's known biodiversity. The Amazon is referred to as the ""lungs of the planet"" and plays a major role in regulating the climate. The world would drastically change if the rainforest were to disappear, with impacts on everything from farms to drinking water.How many fires are burning?In a 48-hour period, leading up to Thursday, there were more than 2,500 active fires in the Brazilian rainforest, the BBC reported Friday. The smoke from the fires is visible from space. The European Union Earth Observation Program's Sentinel satellites captured images of ""significant amounts of smoke"" over Amazonas, Rondonia and other areas. NASA has been monitoring the fires. Over the past week, satellites from the EU and NASA have been tweeting images of the smoke on social media. Satellites have also kept tabs on the uptick in fires over this year, according to NASA. On Aug. 20, Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist, tweeted data showing smoke from the fires covering about half of Brazil. Later in the week, the BBC tweeted a map showing similar data. The skies blackened over San Paulo, Brazil, for an hour Aug. 19 after a cold front caused winds to shift and carry smoke from about 1,700 miles away. On Friday, Telesur TV reported that smoke from the fires could be seen in Argentina. Have the fires been put out?The fires are still active. On Saturday, Amnesty International captured a photo of the burned forests in the Mato Grosso state. Bolsonaro was mobilizing the Brazilian army to combat the flames, Euronews reported.The patchy rain expected through Sept. 10 is only expected to bring minor relief but won't help to extinguish the fire, Reuters reported Tuesday. The rain that's forecast for the next two weeks is reportedly set to fall in the areas that need it the least. While Bolsonaro faces criticism, US President Donald Trump tweeted his support on Tuesday. Bolsonaro responded and said Brazil is fighting the wildfires with ""great success."" Last week, Trump said the US stood ready to assist fighting the fires.Bolivia President Evo Morales contracted a Boeing 747 ""Supertanker"" last week to help extinguish the fires, Telesur reported. The Supertanker is capable of flying with 115,000 liters (over 30,000 gallons) and was expected to be operational Friday.Was any action taken at the G7 Summit?Bolsonaro rejected a $20 million aid package from the G7 countries that would go toward extinguishing the flames devastating the rainforest. His chief of staff reportedly said French President Emmanuel Macron should take care of ""his home and his colonies,"" according to the Guardian. Bolsonaro reportedly said Brazil would only consider the international aid if Macron retracted comments that he found offensive about his country's indigenous protection policies.Bolsonaro's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed his country will continue to support the efforts to save the Amazon. He said Monday that Canada is offering to send $15 million and ""water bombers"" to help fight the fires, the CBC reported Monday.In late August, the G7 Summit -- an annual meeting of the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US -- agreed on the aid package, according to The Hill on Monday. Brazil's president originally had accepted the aid and tweeted that Brazil is committed to environmental protection.What else are politicians doing to help?Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro expressed concern about the fires devastating Brazil and Bolivia and offered aid to help extinguish them. The Venezuelan Chancellery also expressed solidarity with the indigenous communities in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Ecuador and Peru.""Venezuela expresses its deep concern about the gigantic and terrible fires that devastate the Amazon region in the territory of several South American countries, with very serious impacts on the population, ecosystems and biological diversity of the area,"" Venezuela's Ministry of Popular Power for Foreign Affairs said in a statement to Brasil247 on Friday. The government of Venezuela also proposed a meeting of foreign ministers of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization on Friday, posting a letter from Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza.Finland's Prime Minister, Antti Rinne, also released a statement saying that the fires in Brazil were ""extremely serious"" and that he had contacted the European Commission. ""Brazilian rainforests are vital for the world's climate. I am truly worried about the attitude Brazil seems to have adopted right now regarding its own forests. Brazil should do all it takes to end the fires that are a danger to our whole civilization,"" Rinne said in the statement. In addition, UK Member of Parliament Rebecca Long-Bailey drafted a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, asking Johnson to tell Bolsonaro that the destruction of the Amazon must stop.Bolsonaro has faced criticism. People are accusing him of lack of action and of encouraging logging and farming in the Amazon. In early July, an anonymous senior Brazilian official told the BBC that Bolsonaro encouraged deforestation. Ricardo Galvão, the director of the INPE, was fired Aug. 2 after defending data that showed deforestation was 88% higher in June than it was a year ago, CNN reported. How did the public respond? Apple's Tim Cook appears to be the first tech CEO to respond with an offer of aid. On Monday, Cook tweeted that Apple would be donating to help, but he didn't specify an amount. #ActForTheAmazon began trending on Twitter and protests began last week. In Zurich, activists from the Klimastreik Ecological Movement and Brazilians assembled outside of the Brazilian Consulate on Friday morning. In Dublin, the Extinction Rebellion Collective occupied the Brazilian Embassy. Twitter users captured images of a protest in Barcelona as well. Demonstrations have also taken place in Paris, London, Madrid and Copenhagen, Denmark.The hashtags #PrayforAmazonas and #AmazonRainforest were trending earlier last week. Twitter users criticized the media for giving more attention to the fire at Notre Dame and other news than to the rainforest fires. Social media users also called out billionaires for lack of donations. ""The Club calls on international lenders and institutions to reconsider their investments in Brazil after President Jair Bolsonaro's reckless exploitation and destruction of a critical resource for the future of humanity,"" Javier Sierra, the Sierra Club's associate director of communications for Latino media, said in an email. Sierra pointed out that both Norway and Germany have already said they would cease to provide funds for the Amazon's preservation until Bolsonaro reverses course. ""Those who destroy the Amazon and let deforestation continue unabated are encouraged in doing so by the Bolsonaro government's actions and policies. Since taking office, the current government has been systematically dismantling Brazil's environmental policy,"" Danicley Aguiar of Greenpeace Brazil said in a release Thursday.The World Wildlife Fund's European policy office released a statement the same day. The organization called on Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname to protect the amazon, fight deforestation and reduce the causes of the fire. The WWF also addressed the EU and its Member States to take action as well.In addition, actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio added a donation link to Amazon Watch on his Instagram profile and posted about the fires. Celebrities like Jameela Jamil, Jaden Smith and John Cusack have also taken to social media to speak out about the fiery devastation.

À sa naissance, Sarah a reçu un diagnostic de Trisomie 21 accompagné de plusieurs autres problèmes de santé associés (cardiopathie, endocrinologie…) Le père de Sarah et moi avons donc vécu beaucoup d’épreuves qui ont menées à notre séparation. Nous avons toujours désiré le meilleur pour Sarah. Pour ce faire, j'ai déménagé sur la Rive-Sud de Québec afin que le CRDI puisse lui donner un meilleur accompagnement, je l’ai changé de CPE afin qu’elle bénéficie d'une éducatrice spécialisée en tout temps et j'ai changé d'emploi afin de trouver le bon équilibre entre la vie familiale et professionnelle.QU'EST-CE QU'UNE CHAMBRE HYPERBARE?La chambre hyperbare est une machine dans laquelle une personne peut faire des séances d'oxygénothérapie. Ce traitement permet d'oxygéner des parties du cerveau, plus particulièrement les cellules responsables de la motricité globale (coordination des mouvements, aide au niveau musculaire), de la motricité fine et du langage. Il permet d'activer des zones du cerveau peu ou pas fonctionnelles chez l'enfant. Plusieurs études (qui ne sont pas encore reconnues au Canada) démontrent de hauts taux d’efficacité dans l’amélioration de la qualité de vie des personnes ayant des difficultés motrices, neurologiques, sensorielles ou intellectuelles. Un physiatre du CHU de Sainte-Justine (Dr. Marois) effectue actuellement des recherches sur les bienfaits du traitement en chambre hyperbare sur des enfants atteints de trisomie, d'autiste, de paralysie cérébrale et autres.QUELS SONT LES BIENFAITS POUR SARAH?Voyant les résultats des recherches portant sur les effets d’une chambre hyperbare sur les enfants atteints de la Trisomie 21, j’ai trouvé une excellente compagnie qui nous a loué une machine pour une période d’essai de 100 jours. Dès les premières semaines du traitement, les bienfaits ont été INCROYABLES! J’ai donc décidé d’acheter cette machine pour permettre à Sarah de continuer de bénéficier de tous les bienfaits qu’elle lui apporte. Cela fait maintenant 5 mois que Sarah fait ce traitement et elle a maintenant un contact visuel avec nous (ce qu'elle n'avait pas auparavant), elle commence à parler, son niveau de concentration s'est multiplié, sa motricité fine s’est grandement améliorée (elle sait maintenant boire avec une paille, ce qui était très difficile avec ses muscles faciaux) et elle a même développé assez de tonus musculaire et de coordination pour apprendre à faire du vélo! Cette chambre hyperbare change significativement la vie actuelle de ma fille.  Dans sa vie future, celle-ci l'aidera grandement à accentuer son autonomie, ce qui lui permettra probablement à l'aider à trouver un emploi ou même se trouver un appartement.   QUE POUVEZ-VOUS FAIRE POUR NOUS AIDER?Le coût d’achat de la chambre hyperbare est très dispendieux (près de 15 000 $, duquel est déduit les coûts de location payés pour la période d’essai, soit un peu plus de 4 300 $). Ma famille et mes amis m’ont déjà beaucoup aidé pour amasser la somme nécessaire à l’essai de 100 jours. J’ai également investi toutes mes économies dans ce projet. Cependant, il manque encore près de 6 500 $ pour acquitter les derniers versements. Je vous demande de l'aide afin de nous permettre d’amasser les fonds manquants pour acquérir la chambre hyperbare.Merci de votre collaboration et nous espérons que vous participerez généreusement à ce projet important qui permettra d’accroître l’autonomie de Sarah et de possiblement aider la recherche pour tous ces enfants qui ont de grands défis.","November 18, 2019","$3,916","$6,500 "

""Cały opis po polsku jest na spodzie""

•My name is Bartlomiej “Bart” Rypel and I was born on 10/18/1988. I had medical issues from the beginning. , I was born with a genetic disease called Neurofibromatosis ,” NF1” which is a condition characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation) and the growth of tumors along nerves in the skin, brain, and other parts of the body. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely among affected people.” The tumors that are bothersome are the ones on my tongue and inside my mouth because it is hard to talk, and people have a hard time understanding me. Along with NF1 had a learning disability so school was a little hard for me.•In 1997 I was told that I have scoliosis and I might need surgery to fix it. But first, they put me in a brace for a year that didn’t work during that time they also found tumors on the back on my head lower neck spot because NF1 causes tumors around your full body. My parents had to figure out what they would do so surgery was the best choice and in 1998 the surgery took place. I spent time in the hospital for weeks recovering learning to hold my head up and learning to walk at age 10 it’s super scary and hard for a kid to take this in. But the surgery went good they took out the tumors. Checkups were done next step, was the scoliosis what will be done because it would be a big long surgery. The doctors said If I wouldn’t do the surgery within 2 years I would be in a wheelchair.•In August 1999 I had to get that surgery for my scoliosis. I was scared again because the doctors told me if the surgery would fail I may not walk again. It was the day of the surgery I believe it took about 12 hours they had to take each disk out and put rods and screws. When I came out of surgery my head was so big due to my face being flat for 12 hours. But surgery was a success. Recovery took some time I had to learn yet again to walk. A lot of pain I don’t wish no one this pain I had•To add to the list I was diagnosed with hepatitis B. And growth deficiency, which I had to take growth hormone shots on a daily basis by my mom. In January of 2017, my dad found out he has bladder cancer. It was time to look after him. Around that time I noticed my left hand was losing feeling and my back was starting to hurt more and more. Now my dad is starting chemo which he beat and is cancer-free since but they had to remove his bladder. It’s summer of 2018 and I noticed my legs are red and big. But I was thinking it just from a bug or something and at night I had a hard time falling asleep but in the day time, I would just fall asleep a lot sitting up. For a little while, I would just sleep in a chair.•One day my feet are still red and big I had pain in my chest. My mom took me into the ER they took me right away I had a virus. And my oxygen levels were below 80. The virus went out of my feet but I had a bigger problem why am I not sleeping in bed and I would just fall asleep at random. They took an x-ray of the chest, it turned out that my left lung was covered with tumors and the spine was pressing on my trachea. There was a risk of suffocation. The next step is to get surgery to do a C1-C2 Complex Fusion. Which they put a plate with rods in my skull going down my spine into my old rods from 1999 surgery. Not only that but I have sleep apnea now.•In November 2018 the surgery took place this surgery was the worst one of them all. I had to yet again learn how to walk. But now I am no longer able to turn my head around at all just in one spot. It is so hard getting used to it when people talk to me I have to turn my whole body to look at them. I sleep on my left side with a CPAP mask on and my left hand is still not back to normal. Which the doctors didn’t figure out yet what is the case of that. It’s 2019 seeing more and more new doctors for my NF1. I was told that they have a new medication to stop the tumors for getting big just waiting on more info on that. My driving is no longer the same because I can’t turn my head to see if I have a car coming my way. I also have a hard time hearing out of my left ear. The NF has occupied my left side.•I was on social security disability for many years but 3 years ago it got canceled off of it. According to social security, I am able to work. But, anywhere I apply no one wants to hire me. Which I understand, who would want to be responsible for any injuries I can have. Cant move from side to side. So, I am•In a very tight situation because I have bills to pay but no income coming in. I would like to buy some medical equipment such as a rising bed mattress, sleeping CPAP masks, portable CPAP machine and much more medical needs for the future. My parents would help me out but how much help can you get. They live there own lives and have their own bills. And to fight social security to get my benefits back I would need an attorney which costs money. Which brings me to this and ask if you can help me out. Every dollar counts for me because I have no income, no way of supporting myself.From the bottom of my heart, I thank you very much for all the help, hopefully you can share my story.Bart.

Od początku miałem problemy ze zdrowiem urodziłem sie z choroba genetyczna Nerwiakowlukniowatosc typ1  “NF1” która jest schorzeniem charakteryzującym się zmianami barwy skóry (pigmentacji) i wzrostem guzów i wluknikow wzdłuż nerwów w skórze, mózgu i inne części ciała. Objawy dotknięte chorobą różnią się znacznie. ”Niepokojące są guzy na języku i w jamie ustnej, ponieważ trudno jest mówić, a ludzie mają trudności ze zrozumieniem mnie. Wraz z NF1 miałem trudności w nauce, więc szkoła była dla mnie trochę trudna.• W 1997 roku powiedziano mi, że mam skoliozę i być może potrzebuję operacji, aby ją naprawić. Ale najpierw umieścili mnie w aparacie na rok, który nie działał w tym czasie, znaleźli również guzy na plecach na mojej dolnej części szyi, ponieważ NF1 powoduje guzy w całym ciele i włókniaki które atakuje najbardzej unerwione miejsca.w tym caly kręgosłup Moi rodzice musieli zdecydować co zrobic, więc operacja była najlepszym wyborem, w 1998 r. Miała miejsce operacja. Kilka tygodni spędziłem w szpitalu, odzyskując naukę utrzymywania głowy i chodzenia w wieku 10 lat. To bardzo przerażające i trudne dla dziecka, aby to przyjąć. Ale operacja poszła dobrze, że wyjęli guzy. Kolejnym krokiem były kontrole, czy skolioza zostanie wykonana, ponieważ byłaby to długa operacja. Lekarze powiedzieli, że gdybym nie zrobił operacji w ciągu 2 lat, byłbym na wózku inwalidzkim.• W sierpniu 1999 roku musiałem poddać się operacji skoliozy. Znowu się przestraszyłem, bo lekarze powiedzieli mi, że jeśli operacja się nie powiedzie, mogę już nie chodzić. To był dzień operacji, która, jak sądzę, zajęła około 12 godzin. Musieli wyciągnąć każdy dysk i włożyć pręty i śruby. Kiedy wzbudziłem sie po operacji, moja głowa była jak bardzo duza dynia i potworny bol, Ale operacja zakończyła się sukcesem. Wyzdrowienie zajęło trochę czasu. Musiałem jeszcze raz nauczyć się chodzić. Dużo bólu Nie życzę nikomu takiego bólu, jaki miałem• Aby dodać do listy, zdiagnozowano u mnie zapalenie wątroby typu B. I niedobór hormonu wzrostu,moja mama codziennie przez 2 lata wstrzykiwała mi zastrzyk z hormonem. W styczniu 2017 r. Mój tata dowiedział się, że ma raka pęcherza. Czas się nim zaopiekować. W tym czasie zauważyłem, że moja lewa ręka traci czucie, a plecy zaczęły mnie coraz bardziej boleć. Teraz mój tata zaczyna chemię, którą pokonał i jest wolny od raka, ale oni musieli usunąć jego pęcherz. Jest lato 2018 roku i zauważyłem, że moje nogi są czerwone i bardzo opuchnięte , ciężko mi było zasnąć,balem sie zasypiac w lozku spalem na krześle było to bardzo meczące .• Pewnego dnia moje nogi bardzo były czerwone i  spuchnięte, miałem ból w klatce piersiowej. Moja mama zabrała mnie do szpital, zabrali mnie od razu, miałem wirusa. A mój poziom tlenu był poniżej 80. Wirus zszedł z moich stóp, ale miałem większy problem, dlaczego nie śpię w łóżku i po prostu zasypiam przypadkowo. Zrobili zdjęcie rentgenowskie klatki piersiowej, okazało sie ze moje lewe pluco jest pokryte guzami  a kręgosłup naciskał na moja tchawice. groziło to uduszeniem. Następnym krokiem jest poddanie się operacji zespolenia złożonego C1-C2. Które umieścili talerz z prętami w mojej czaszce, idąc w dół kręgosłupa do moich starych prętów po operacji w 1999 roku. Nie tylko to, ale teraz mam bezdech senny.W listopadzie 2018 r. Miała miejsce operacja, która była najgorszą ze wszystkich. Musiałem jeszcze raz nauczyć się chodzić. Ale teraz nie jestem już w stanie odwrócić głowy tylko w jednym miejscu. Co tak trudno się przyzwyczaić, kiedy ludzie ze mną rozmawiają, muszę obrócić całe ciało, żeby na nich spojrzeć. Śpię na lewej stronie z założoną maską CPAP, a moja lewa ręka wciąż nie wraca do normy. Czego lekarze jeszcze się nie dowiedzieli. W 2019 roku ale czuje ze choroba spowodowała niedowład reki ,pojawia się coraz więcej nowych lekarzy dla mojego NF1. Powiedziano mi, że mają nowy lek, który powstrzyma guzy przed powiększeniem się, czekam na więcej informacji na ten temat. Moja jazda nie jest już taka sama, ponieważ nie mogę obrócić głowy, aby zobaczyć, czy zbliża się samochód.

Ruby Redeau ,"Port Arthur, TX",Other,"Hello Everyone, I'm raising money to be able to find a place to stay. I was in a wreck in February 2018 where I was hit by an 18 wheeler. Which do to my injuries I can not work right now. I lost my job which was my source of income, house and transportation.  And February this year has made it 2 years. I met someone that took me in but now due to his verbal, emotional, physical and mental abuse I have to leave. Sometimes I can stand up and walk but my sciatic nerve in my left leg is severed. I have injuries to my lower back and the back of my head. So for the most part I live daily in pain. I'm still in therapy 3 times a week. I take 28 shots in my back every other week ease the pain and I have a tens unit. I also have asthma and High Blood Pressure but I don't have medical insurance.  I was just in the ER about 3 maybe 4 weeks ago with blood pressure 178/132 but it's crazy how hard it is to even come up with $8 just for my medicine for my blood pressure. I'm just searching for help til my case settles so I can get out of harms way.  And for anyone that is so kind enough to contribute to helping me may God bless you and your family 100 times over.","February 25, 2020",$200,"$3,000 "
Rhiannon Hurd ,"Leander, TX","Medical, Illness & Healing","Upon birth Noah Augustus aka 'Gus Gus' was diagnosed with a hypoplastic transverse aortic arch. This diagnosis requires a lengthy NICU admission, open heart surgery, recovery, rehabilitation, home health visits, and an abundance of prayer. At 24 hours old, Noah Augustus went on his first airplane ride to Houston, Texas. Although this plane ride was not for vacation or leisure, doctors in Austin deemed the transfer necessary to ensure Noah is provided with the highest quality of care from high trained and skilled healthcare professionals at Texas Children's Hospital. The entire recovery process is at an estimated 6-8 weeks, as long as there are no interruptions (surgery goes well, no infections, etc) in Houston at Texas Children's Hospital. During this time the parents (Alphonse & Halana) will have to focus on various expenses such as lodging, food, hospital bills, and activities/childcare for Noah's big sister Mariah. We are creating this GoFundMe for the strong courgeous support system (soldiers) in #NoahsArmy. Join us as we come together to lift one less stress from this beautiful family's life.

Gregg Purcell ,"Verdun, QC","Creative Arts, Music & Film","UPDATE 2020/02/20 -  Hey Everybody, Just wanted to let you all know that I will be providing updates regularly.  So check back often to stay updated.I do realize that this will be a bit of a process and that I most likely will have to begin production in small steps to be able to garner more donations. So when I reach the $1500 mark, I will begin shooting some interviews and will develop a teaser trailer.I really appreciate all the shares and retweets you have all been doing. It helps  a lot. (Scroll down below video to read full description on the project)                                                      Hello everybody,We are all aware of the shape that Canada is in today... Not good. We are quite possibly on the last legs of Canadian values. We have a ""leader"" who is dead set on changing our identity completely.All of our nations establishment political parties have no plans on changing the direction we are headed. Only the People's Party of Canada does. It does not seem as though the PPC has much of a chance of getting into the position to make those changes though. Why? Because their exposure is minimal and the Left wing controlled mainstream media will never give them any fair or honest coverage.So, what can we do to change that? Well, each of us must give and do what we as single individuals are able to give and do. We are the ""People"" in People's Party after all.For me personally, it is film work. Film work that can expose what the party is all about to citizens.I reached out to Maxime Bernier (Head of the PPC) on Twitter and offered my services to the party. The individual who manages his social media account responded that they just do not have the funds at this time to hire me. Which is understandable because they are still a new up and coming party.So I have decided that I want to make a documentary. I want this to be a good documentary that people can watch and give credibility to, and that just can't be done with no money.So I am looking to get $20,000 for it.I am well aware that $20,000 is absolute peanuts when it comes to film making. But I am just looking for the bare minimum possible. I do know that even getting this amount has a very small chance of happening because everybody is going through very rough times in this country right now, including myself. Damn, it's the reason we're all so fed up with the way things are, isn't it?I want to make clear that this would be a completely independent project and is not an authorized project by the PPC. It will be done from my own individual purview, which will make it better and a lot more credible if you ask me. Not propagandist driven.I also want to make sure everyone knows that this will not be a project to make profit with. I feel the need  to do whatever I can to open Canadian's eyes up and have them realize the only common sense platform there is to insure them, their children and their grandchildren have a decent future in this country.So this documentary will be uploaded free for everybody to see and share on every platform. Some of the issues I would tackle in this documentary are:- How & why the PPC came to fruition- Exposing Justin Trudeau's blatant corruption and how his government is giving Canada completely away-Immigration - The United Nation's stronghold over our CountryBut most importantly...-Going in depth and explaining what the policies on each parties platform actually mean. A lot of people (I'd say most people actually) vote with blindness to what anything they are voting for even means. They watch the mainstream media and choose who's voice they like more when hitting talking points on issues that mean absolutely nothing at all.For example, the thing that stuck out most to me about the PPC platform was the abolishment of the Capital Gains Tax.I guarantee you, you can ask 50 people what the Capital Gains Tax is and at least 35 of them won't have a single clue about it.There are many other things to cover as well, I am just giving a brief rundown.If the money can be raised, here is what it would go towards,- Transportation & low cost motel's if interviews can be garnered in different cities with certain people. (People running for MP positions in different ridings, PPC Members, Experts on the different issues we would be covering, and hopefully if it could be possible, Maxime Bernier himself)- Minimal equipment rentals- Help with different aspects of the production- If anything leftover, Money for myself to live with as this would take a big chunk of my life, both time wise and work wise. I want to thank everybody for even reading this far.If this money can be generated by mid March I will immediately begin production.If it can't be, that is completely understandable, as I said, I'm aware it is rough times for everybody these days.If somehow even more than the $20,000 I am asking for is raised, That would give me more to work with for the project and would literally be life changing for myself.Thanks A lot everybody,- Gregg Purcell (A.K.A Gordon Burling) ","February 13, 2020",$645,"$20,000 "

Who , what , where , why and how Officially, I’m just a debt slave but I am a Human being having a spiritual experience with a medical emergency in a time when it’s incredibly popular to be dehumanizing. Sometimes fundraising events take a couple of years to garner high-level support, unfortunately time isn’t something that I have the privilege of  . God didn’t  give me a JOB with a broken hand  and you know Satan don’t   give you a credit card without one !  

Here in Canada under the present unemployment  legislation working class Canadians are  being denied a medical ei claim due to the dehumanizing regulations and penalties attached with regular claim  legislation , so what’s medical benefits for?! You would think it’s insurance that you pay into that keeps you off a soup line or worst the cold foundations that our cities are built on when you have and incident that leaves you unable to work and I know all  this because this is my third  time in my Entire life that I’ve had to apply for medical benefits  and it’s the first time I was denied, second time I was discriminated and I hoping this  time will be charm and my experiences can help change legislation to keep my country men Out of a Soup line in this increasing popularized dehumanizing pursuit of increased middle class homelessness I am in, with both feet and my one good hand ! 

We live in a time of high tech communication and there’s no excuse for never being properly informed or having your benefits put on hold for biased reasons from within the minds of our federal employees. hence ;  Attorney General of Canada v Kos, 2005 FCA 319. The key issue here was whether file notes by an insurance officer constituted a “decision” that triggered the time limit. The court ruled that it did not, in part because the notes were not communicated to the claimant . 

 If I’d  been properly informed in any of my inquiries over the last year either by mail , telephone or in person in any of the service Canada center's leading up to this frightening humiliating life changing experience I might not be panhandling for real change asking for spare change today, living in a RV , displaced , bruised , broken and permanently scared With no clue were my next hot meal is coming from after preparing and serving tens of thousands of hot meals in remote services to the working classes but here  I-am and I think our medical unemployment should be there not matter what, for all Canadians who get injured just as much as our government is there for American stock holders in an old pipeline , SNC Lavalin and the Highly affluent Irving family , don't you?! 

It’s in these times you find out who your friends, family , co workers  and society are while trying to understand why the government of Canada is middle aged white cat that doesn’t care for salad or the working classes .

 I’ve  enlisted  the assistant of Cathy McLeod  a Conservative MP in Kamloops BC and I’m eagerly awaiting to plant my feet and connect the dots with Bob Zimer Conservative MP who has had his office intervene 3 times with unemployment benefits . I have 5 more Weeks before my  hand is healed and with your help and my determination we can make real changes with a party that promises to be the People’s representation while Justin Trudeau is campaigning for a better Canada and  forgiving 7.4 million in  loans ?! 

In closing I am full of hope for what we can accomplish by working together and alongside our Newly sworn in MPs 

We are the change and With great appreciation I thank you for your time , support and donations.

Elizabeth H Lee ,"Saipan, MP","Missions, Faith & Church","Arise Immanuel is a disaster relief and recovery fund to rebuild and restore Immanuel Mission Methodist Church on the island of Saipan.Super Typhoon Yutu, a category 5 equivalent, made landfall Wednesday, October 24, 2018, on the islands of Saipan and Tinian. The eye of the storm hovered over the islands for hours with gushing windspeeds of up to 185 mph, destroying everything in its path.  In fact, Yutu has been declared one of the strongest storms on record to hit US soil and the most powerful storm on Earth this year.  In the wake of Super Typhoon Yutu, Immanuel Mission Methodist Church sustained severe damages beyond repair. The devastating losses to the community are both immense and heartbreaking.Immanuel Mission Methodist Church is our family’s church.  In 1990, our parents were called to lead the church in Saipan.  This year marked nearly 28 years of their dedicated ministry, serving together with and alongside church members.  Right now, the only path forward is to provide immediate relief needs to recover from the devastation of Yutu.  The community is so close-knit that immediately after the storm calmed, members gathered at the church, despite their homes being completely destroyed.  The church is such an integral part of their daily lives that upon seeing my parents’ damaged home, members quickly proceeded to patch and seal the gaping walls and windows to provide a temporary shelter. Thanks to all the prayers, the church was able to secure a temporary location at a local school to hold Sunday services.  While response efforts are still on the way, Arise Immanuel is on a mission dedicated towards the immediate and long-term recovery and restoration of the church and the community.  Yutu may have destroyed the walls and collapsed the roofs, but by faith and in truth, Immanuel Mission Methodist Church will rise. You too can be a part of this story – Arise Immanuel!About the organizers:We (Hanna, Jennifer, and Elizabeth - the Lee’s sisters) are the organizers of this campaign fundraising on behalf of Immanuel Mission Methodist Church.  Immanuel Mission Methodist Church is our family’s church. Our dad, in his early 30’s, brought his wife (our mom) and his three young daughters to the island of Saipan to start this ministry.  There were no water or electricity when we first came.  There was a one story structure at the time. We lived in a small room built adjacent to the church.  As years went by, the church was enlarged and our home was rebuilt adjacent to the church building.  The church was where we grew up.  It is where we experienced the power of electricity and running water.  We all left our home and now live in different parts of the world, but our parents are still there today. This year marked their 28th year of ministry. Our hearts are broken seeing this devastation and our hearts ache not being able to help physically on site.  Along with our prayers, we set up this campaign to provide financial support for the church to help in any immediate disaster relief and recovery needs.  Unfortunately, there are some technicalities when it comes to U.S. territories so the funds cannot be directly sent to our church in Saipan. It breaks our heart to know that such unreasonable restrictions and limitations are still present in U.S. territories in this day and age. As of now, our intermediary plan is to withdraw the funds to Elizabeth Lee (one of the organizers of this fundraiser) who will then send the fund as a gift to the church.  All donations will go towards meeting immediate disaster relief and long-term recovery needs. For any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.","October 28, 2018","$12,150","$10,000 "
Bethany Elizabeth ,,Accidents & Emergencies,"
My name is Bethany. I am a transgender girl living on the Caribbean island of Barbados. I am also the artist and writer of my own website: Bethania Arts (bethaniaarts.com )While to some that may seem like a dream to live in the Caribbean, unfortunately for those of the LGBT community here, it is a nightmare here. While other countries have laws protecting LGBT individuals, Barbados and the other Caribbean islands do not, making the discrimination of LGBT persons acceptable in the public eye. For those of you who don't know about the events that transpired in my life, please read my two articles on my website:[*] How I Escaped My Abusive And Manipulative Parents. [*] It Was All A Trap: From One Dysfunctional Home To The Next. For this reason, it is not safe for me to remain here and I have to leave as soon as necessary before I find myself on the street with nowhere to go.That is why I have to seek asylum in the country of Canada, and there will hopefully be a far greater chance of me succeeding in taking my life towards a better future.Expenses* Flight ticket from Barbados to Toronto, Canada -$400 USD ($585 AUD)* Lawyer fees for immigration - $2500 USD estimated.* Taxi or Public transport - $60 USD estimated.* Winter clothing - $60 USD estimated.* Any extra goes toward food, or possible housing arrangements.As you can see, I have the goal set as $400 USD / $585 AUD. It's the minimum I need to get on the flight. The best circumstance would be covering the other expenses which I'm assuming is going to be around $700-$1000 USD ($1023-$1462 AUD), excluding most lawyer fees. However, if anyone who lives in Canada knows methods of cutting costs, then do let me know. ""Why is this set in AUD/Australia? How will you receive the money?""GoFundMe only supports a handful of countries; Barbados is not one of them. That's why one of my closest friends in Australia, Nat (Nadya), will have the responsibility of getting the money to me by first using it to pay for my trip and then  for me to later arrange setting up a banking account in Canada so he can send the rest of donations.Note: $1.46AUD =  $1 USD. Donating $15 AUD  equates to around $10 USD.I know, it's a rather confusing process, but it's sadly the best I can do as I don't have anyone else I think I can trust enough in the US or Canada to ensure all goes well for me to set up a US/CAD GoFundMe campaign (plus Nat is a brother to me).Unfortunately, thanks to my parents blocking my account and VISA card so I can't use them, it's another reason I have to take this process. Why I need your help.I can't pay for pretty much anything on my list of fees/expenses besides for a handful of food. Honestly if I had the bare minimum to pay for my flight to Toronto, I wouldn't really consider using GoFundMe. The last thing I want is to do is feel the need to ask for money from persons I most likely can't repay.As a transgender individual in the conservative/religious island of Barbados, there is really no job opportunities for someone such as myself. Thus, I've been unemployed ever since having to leave my parents' home.In fact, I studied to be a teacher for three years knowing fully that there was no way any school on the island would accept a transgender individual as a teacher. The hope was to finish my degree and then leave for the UK where laws are much more LGBT friendly.""When do you need it by?""January 2020.That's the date I am aiming for. It may be subject to later on only if my temporary living situation changes or if the maximum goal is hit sooner than expected.---I would like to thank you all of you who contribute or share this to help achieve the goal I set.  Honestly, if this all goes through, then there may just be hope at the end of this tunnel.

Katie Melsopp ,"Birmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom","Medical, Illness & Healing","Hello,We would like to share our heartbreaking story about our beloved big sister Suzanne and ask for your help to raise funds for treatment to help to save her life. In May 2018, at the age of just 32, our wonderful sister Sue was diagnosed with a grade 4 Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer and along with the journey she has faced she continues to fight for her life. We hope that Sue's story will help to raise awareness about this awful condition that she is currently fighting and we hope that we are able to find a treatment to beat cancer and brain tumours. UK figures suggest that 11,000 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour each year. We would like to raise awareness as we have read less than 2% of donations to cancer research is spent on brain tumours. This is also the same condition that the inspiring MP Dame Tessa Jowell was battling but now had sadly passed.Our story starts towards the end of 2017 when Sue was concerned that her vision was ‘funny’ and that she was feeling increasingly tired and fatigued. Sue never made a fuss and carried on with everyday life and work for a couple of months until she booked herself into the opticians for an eye test where no concerns were raised. Sue continued to have episodes of new symptoms such as numbness, weakness and increased sensation down her left side. Sue continued to go on and eventually booked in to see the GP as she was still concerned about her symptoms. Sue was given routine blood tests and it appeared that she had next to none vitamin D which she was prescribed and taking supplements, but this shown no changes to her symptoms, in fact they continued to get worse.In May 2018, we heard that Sue was having difficulty writing and grasping with her left hand and eventually she was complaining her skin was very sensitive and sore to touch on her left arm. Sue was quite convinced that her symptoms were related to the vitamin deficiency. It was only when we seen Sue, on the day that we all met to go shopping, that we become increasingly concerned for her seeing how much difficulty she was having to function. We noticed that Sue was slightly dragging her left foot, and on top of all her other symptoms we immediately demanded that she was to go back to see the doctor as we were not convinced that this was a vitamin deficiency causing these symptoms and something much more serious.Following the appointment the next day, the doctor referred Sue straight to Heartlands Hospital for urgent scans. The consultant then gave us the devastating news that it was a brain tumour. What's more, the tumour was approximately 5cm when it was discovered and situated on the right side of the frontal lobe of the brain, hence the symptoms effecting her left side. Our hearts were completely shattered but we knew we had to stay strong for Sue and hope that she would recieve the best news for her diagnosis. Sue was then referred to the Queen Elizabeth hospital where she underwent further scans an blood tests. We also discovered that day that she had lost the peripheral vision in her left eye as the tumour was blocking her vision. The Neurosurgeons decided the should try to surgically remove as much of the mass and fluid as possible so Sue underwent brain surgery for about 8 hours whilst the surgeons tried delicately to remove and get a biopsy. Sue spent the following 10 days in hospital recovering from her operation and was told that the surgeons could not remove any of the tumour as it was too close to vital parts of the brain, however they were able to obtain a small sample for a biopsy and reduce the fluid on the brain which was aggrovating some of her symptoms. As Sue was recovering in hopsital, we recieved the terrible news that the tumour was malignant. The devostation was unbearable for us all. We could only imagine how Sue was feeling having this cancerous tumour on her brain, a condition so cruel and extremely hard to accept. We will never forget that look of fear and disappointment in her face, and being told that it is incurable and no treatment to heal her. Our whole world turned upside down, feeling helpless and guilt, and yet trying to stay so positive to keep Sue fighting this evil disease because she IS so strong and we know she will not give up fighting until the end.Since July 2018, Sue had an intensive six weeks of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy with the aim to shrink and contain the brain tumour. She continued to have further chemotherapy. Indications are by latest MRI is that the tumour is still growing. Sue is no longer suitable for conventional surgery due to the type and location of tumour. Sue has had the maximum amount of radiotherapy they can offer and is not suitable for any current clinical trails or treatments. With all our hopes shattered an clutching at strings watching Sue still be so positive about the whole situation, right from the start and the awfully hard journey she has done to get where she is today, we owe it to help her fight this disease and prolong life in any way we can.This is our appeal, we would like to ask everyone to please donate whatever you can to help us to SAVE OUR SUE we would be extremely grateful for your help and generosity, every penny raised will go to either help Sue or towards brain tumour research.On behalf of Sue and all her family, we would like to thank you in advanced for reading our story and for any donations made. It would be a pleasure if you could leave your contact details so we can thank you personally.Thank you for reading. ""Please help us save our lovely Suzanne, my eldest daughter, my first born and my whole world. I'v watched Sue turn into a beautiful and talented young woman, so kind and caring, and having the purest of hearts. When we received the distressing news I felt my heart just sink like no words could ever describe. No parent should ever have to hear those words about their children. I will continue to help and support my daughter and keep fighting with her because she is determined to beat this. I pray that my beautiful daughter will be well again. Please help us to save our lovely Sue and give her an opportunity that’s she deserves.

Andrew Capon ,"Sarasota, FL",Education & Learning,"

Hello, and thank you for your time in reading my story. My name is Andrew Capron, Sixteen years ago the most amazing person came into my life, my daughter. Since Sofia was born, I knew she was destined for great things. I’ll never forget one of the newborn cards I received after her birth. It read “imagine the millions of lives this one child will touch.” No written words have ever been more true. Sofia has been a predominately straight “A” student since 3rd grade. She struggled with school at first, but through sheer determination she was able to overcome her problem and began to earn great grades. To this day she maintains a 4.5 weighted GPA. Recently, the car she had saved up for was totaled in an accident. She was okay, thank God, but she prevailed and is working hard to get another. That spirit of never giving up and smiling in the face of adversity is only one of the qualities that makes her so special. 

More recently she made the decision to go on a Corp mission to Hawaii for community work credit hours. Add to this that she works part time 15-20 hours a week, she is a member of the varsity track team, plays  JV soccer, is an Equestrian, and volunteers on teen court and other causes whenever she has spare time. She has done all of this solely on her own. She never asks for help, She applied for the GLA scholarship for this program and won it. In my very proud and prejudiced opinion, this is one amazing lady.

I would love any support you can offer, the last few years have been tough on the family especially the kids, both financially and emotionally, even in the face of family turmoil she shines through and keeps the peace. Every dollar helps, no matter how big or small. If you can’t afford to send money, then please share this on any social media page. We are also accepting advice & prayers any offering  would be greatly appreciated. 

So far, with scholarship monies and other donations, we still need to raise about $4200. Please know that all money will be used directly for Sofia’s education. Thank you in advance for your time, consideration and contributions. For more information on the exact program she is signing up for please visit

Andrew Edwurds ,"West Brookfield, MA",Accidents & Emergencies,"Hello Everyone,     I am writing to ask for your aid. As of now we are in danger of losing our home, all of our possessions, and our livelihoods as a result of financial troubles.      Unfortunately, the debts left unpaid by my mother have blended into our daily lives and an unexpected turn of events has left us blindsided. If you've read this far what I have to tell you is not only a tale of financial struggle, but is also a tale of death and loss, a tale of grief and sorrow, and most importantly a tale of trying to overcome the odds.    I remember it like it was yesterday. A chilly autumn morning a few days away Thanksgiving, but we weren't enjoying the holiday cheer. Sadly, we were waiting on news of my mother as she had been hospitalized with a severe respiratory illness and her condition was bleak.      My father and I had just left the hospital the night prior, but we hadn't gotten any sleep. The sheer amount of machinery and medication she was on had frightened us, and we were worried about her condition. Almost on cue I heard a phone ringing from downstairs, and based on the early hours of that call I knew it could only mean one thing. I grabbed my coat and headed down, but I'll never forget the look on my father's face as we walked towards the car. His countenance was ashen white, he had his hand over his mouth and his eyes were an unsettling mixture of panic and disbelief. My mother's kidneys had failed and the doctor's had called to let us know her condition was swiftly deteriorating.      Even on the drive over there I didn't really process what I had just heard. My mother was the strongest-willed and probably one of the most successful people I had ever known and I only took this news as a slight roadblock on her path to recovery. Maybe deep down I knew the situation was dire, but I never expected her recovery to be an impossibility. She had been a doctor, a mentor, and a pillar of the community and pillars like that just don't crumble into dust from a short rest in the hospital.     The hospital, quite a miserable place filled with an off-chemical stench and the concentration of death and disease, but she had braved that misery every other week for thirty-plus years. There was no way that which she had conquered would ever come to harm her. Or at least that's what I thought until I felt her cold lifeless hand, watched as her oxygen and heart-rate plummeted, and saw her struggling to breathe. Her body had failed her, but from what the doctors told me I know she didn't give up without a fight and it had only taken until she was sedated for her to really succumb to the illness.      That day I made many phone calls, hugged many relatives, heard many condolences, but even after all that I could hardly process what had happened. My mother was dead. Gone. No more would I greet her coming home from work, no more would I listen to her adventures as a young doctor, and no more would I ever feel her warm embrace. That day was the last day I can remember that I broke down and cried. I couldn't control the surge of emotions that came and I knew that my life would forever be scarred by this moment. But scars heal, only mortal wounds last forever, and I'm not a quitter.     And so it was a month after her passing we learned of her financial situation. The debt was crushing, a mortgage and an equity loan on our family home. $250,000 and some change. Our home, that same one that my family, our two dogs, and I had lived in for the past 20 years. What were we going to do? Our mother had no will so I took it upon myself to take the responsibility of being her Personal Representative, but that responsibility may have been too much to take on. I regretfully say that at the young age of 19 I had no experience as an estate manager, but I think in the end I was able to make the best of a horrible situation.      I knew our current lifestyle was unsustainable, and we couldn't afford to keep paying the $3,000 a month on the mortgage. There was only one option open to us. Sell the house. Sell our home that we grew up in. Sell our castle, our fortress, our place of residence. The place where I had played, the place where I had lived, the place where I had my first kiss, my first swim, and even the place I had my first step. But we couldn't afford to live there, and it had to go.     And that's when misfortune struck again. My father, a Type II diabetic, had gotten a gangrenous infection in his left foot and in the chaos that had resulted from the potential sale of the property, and the passing of my mother it had gone unnoticed. And so it was that we took another trip to the hospital. I wasn't going to lose another parent and the rush of emotions I felt entering that godforsaken place and that lingering chemical aroma gave me an altogether familiar yet unpleasant feeling that I desperately didn't want to become used to.      If we hadn't taken him to the hospital that day my father would have almost certainly lost his life, but instead he only lost his left leg. An unfortunate loss yes, but one that didn't result in another death. But the clock was ticking, we desperately needed to sell the house, but we had no place to live. No way to continue, but in all that chaos we neglected to factor in a crucial calculation.     Taxes, taxes on my mother's income that the government desperately clawed for. Taxes on the IRA we had been living off of. Taxes we weren't calculating because at the time I was a naieve 19 year old, but in the following years I've come to resent those damn numbers.     And that's when our first success came in. It was a year after the house had been put on the market, and even with some unwelcome flood damage that had fortunately been repaired, it sold for a reasonable sum. It was enough to pay off the debt, and pay off the taxes for the year my mother passed, but something loomed around the corner, and this is where the urgency lies.    Remember that IRA I spoke of? The one we had been living off of, the one we bought our meager trailer with, the one that had been our wellspring from which we would build our new foundation? Unbeknownst to me that money we had been relying on had one unfortunate condition that we never factored in. A 37.5% tax, on every single dollar that was withdrawn from that account. The money that went into the trailer, the one we had been buying food with, the one that seemed to be our savior in our time of need turned out to be the sword that ends us. For every triumph we've had, for every success, for every obstacle we've overcome I felt like I had factored everything in, but I never thought there would be a 37.5% tax on something that should've been rightfully my father's. It is with this notion that I turn to the good graces of the internet. I hate begging for money, but I feel as though this may be the one possible way that I can save my family and if you could please donate anything the goal I gave of $50,000 would be an enormous help to all of us. Thank you all, and if you have any specifics you'd like to ask please feel free to message me.","February 16, 2020",$10,"$50,000 "
Andy Saunders ,"Paradise, CA",Accidents & Emergencies,"For those of you out of the area you may not have a grasp on what happened with the fire in Paradise California and surrounding communities. Paradise was a pleasant town of about 27,000 people a few minutes from where our family lives in Chico. The town is gone. Not a neighborhood, not a subdivision, the whole town is gone save for just a few buildings and even those cannot be used for months. There is no power and all the infrastructure is gone. 50,000 people were evacuated and maybe 30,000 have lost their primary residence, but it is more than that when you lose a town. If you lived and worked in Paradise you likely lost your home, the place where your kids go to school, and your job. More than likely you know many of the 700 people that are still missing or the 75+ confirmed dead. Let that sink in, 1 out of every 35 residents of the area is missing or deceased. They evacuated to surrounding communities that were already in a housing crisis. Chico and other communities are full of families housing relatives, parking lots with tents, and shelters bursting at the seams. Wednesday it will start raining which is good for the last of the fire, and horrible news for ash flows that will likely emerge from the town creating flash floods and a further problem for people in shelters and parking lots where the norovirus is spreading fast. Everyone is doing what they can. Our family was lucky and got out of town for a week because the air quality was toxic and we were worried for our daughter. Now that we are back I am taking care of Evelyn while my wife works long hours volunteering with an animal recovery operation. There is no end in sight and the logistical challenges are daunting. What do you do with 3500 school children with no place to finish the semester? What do you do with thousands evacuees who were already poor and now they are poor, homeless, and jobless? The generosity of the community has been incredible. Businesses are offering free services whether they be heating unit repair or massage. People have opened their homes and lives to others they don’t know. But the community can only do so much. My Facebook feed is a stream of destitute families with gofundme accounts and heartbreaking stories. If you feel compelled to help you should make a donation to the North Valley Community Foundation, they keep overhead low, have a great track record and directly help shelters. Mainly I just want folks from out of the area to understand what is happening here. Somewhere between Ivanka Trump news, Monday Night Football, and whatever is happening with the stock market an entire town was wiped out by the deadliest fire in California history. The fire is dying out, but the crisis is in its infancy. My heart hurts, as the reality sets in.-----------------------------------------Below written by Cynthia RobertsMy mind is starting to accept the true magnitude of destruction this firestorm has unleashed. The Camp fire did not just ravage the beautiful community of Paradise and Butte County; its reach spreads far beyond.Andy Saunders is the kind of man who always lends assistance to others when he is able. The kind of person who stops on the side of the road, lord know he loves those backroads, to feed an apple to a horse or simply enjoy the sheer beauty of the wildlife and share it with us, on Facebook. He enjoyed sitting on his back porch watching, Skipper, Jiffer, Black Beauty (Blackie), Ju Ju, Jay Jay, Stevie Ray, Momo, and Grey Wolf play and cuddle with each other. He never wastes food, the deer, turkeys, raccoons, skunks, etc.…, always had a meal; if he ran out of hummingbird juice or seed the birds were sure to let him know.One of Andy’s greatest joys is to bring people together, no matter what their differences, because intrinsically we are all the same. He started gathering together friends, loved ones, & classmates, to honor the memory of his and brother Norm Saunders beloved Mother and Father. Later it morphed into reunion cocktail hours and parties. He was able to find kindhearted musicians to play at little or no fee and whatever that was needed beyond that, Andy took from his own pocket, because family and friends are what it is all about!Andy is a proud man and when I mentioned to him, that I wanted to put a go fund me page together, he did not want to focus on himself, “I will be alright” he exclaimed. He was focused on how grateful he was that Norm, Kyle and his family, Charlene, April & her family, and other community friends, as well as himself, were able to get to safety. However, he truly does need help and so does Norm Saunders!Norm, his child’s mother Tammy, her daughter Marissa, his son Kyle have all been impacted too. Tammy and the children, will most likely be relocating and Norm will need to be near his cherished son. Norm will have to make new connections, find new clients for his carpet cleaning business, find a new place to live, and all that comes with starting over again.Andy’s home, multiple businesses, all of his art collection-including those he sold for business, 9 underinsured classic cars, truck with trailer, RV, mothers poetry, grandparents china and war memorabilia, photos of he and Norm’s family, antique cabinets containing beautiful things passed down several generations, poof gone… Andy is a sentimental man and the latter has just been killing him. In coming days, his mortgage and property tax will be due and he will have to acquire new tools, new work equipment, clothes, shoes, sifters, masks, heavy boots, and all that comes with his new journey.If there is any way you are able to help the Saunders Brothers, no amount is too small. Any resources, gift cards, clothing, well-wishes, advise, etc.…are greatly appreciated!!!Above all…the calls, texts, kind thoughts, well wishes, comradery, and love that you all have already expressed has meant the world!--------------------------------------------------I am Andrew Saunders and I will be distributing funds from this campaign to Norman Saunders to help in his recovery from the Camp Fire Paradise CANorm has a son Kyle who lives with his Mother. Norm is in limbo now and will need to relocate soon to be near Kyle. All proceeds will be used by him to start over.Norm needs housing and food to keep him moving forward.  As soon as donations are made, I distribute to Norm on a weekly basis. Your support is already making a BIG Difference in our lives at the most critical time.Your generosity is appreciated greatly. God Bless you all...   Andy","November 11, 2018","$3,760","$5,000 "
Megan McDaniel Bailey ,"Fredericksburg, VA","Medical, Illness & Healing","If you know Lane Bailey, you're lucky. He's a man that truly knows no bounds to his love and nurturing.  He's loyal, he's brilliant, he's stoic, he's gentle, he's generous. Lane has dedicated his life to serving the people.  To serving the state of West Virginia.  But what you may not know, because he's kept it under wraps, is that he's dying. After struggling for almost a year+ to figure out exactly what was going on with Lane, he was finally diagnosed with MSA-C (Multiple Systems Atrophy), a rare form of Parkinson's affecting between 15,000 - 50,000 Americans. They aren't even 100% sure how to treat it as it doesn't respond to most forms of Parkinson's treatment.The list of hospital stays, procedures, treatments, and drugs is over a mile long.  He's been in ICU and on life support multiple times over the past 12 months, along with two extended stays in a rehab facility.  Lane is no longer mobile and wheelchair bound due to the MSA taking over his balance and coordination (the disease will eventually take over all motor function).  While he can get up from the chair to shuffle to another chair a few feet away, anything more will cause him to take a spill and result in injury.  The number of falls recently, resulting in blood and cuts and bruises, are too many to mention.  Lane has had to undergo a tracheotomy so that he can breath and eat normally, which comes with so many issues of its own (prone to pneumonia, fluid in the lungs, and extensive care). While he still has his voice and is finally able to breath on his own, it has been an uphill battle to get to this point.  Lane can no longer do anything on his own.  He has to have assistance for everything, and we mean EVERYTHING - from the minute he wakes up, until he goes to bed he requires assistance.  From getting dressed, to using the restroom, getting in/out of the bed, taking a shower, getting to/from the car, you name it.  All the things we take for granted, those normal everyday things, he needs help with.  If you know him, you know this is crushing his soul.  This man, this tall, wonderful, joyous man is no longer joyous.  His body is quitting on him and it is so unfair. So so unfair.  He knows he's dying, he knows there is still such a long road ahead, and he knows there isn't a thing he can do about it.  It cannot be stopped, there is no way to stop it. No treatments, no medicine, nothing.  It's just going to get worse.  The medical bills are out of control - currently ticking in at well over $50,000 not covered by any insurance.  The sheer amount of funds needed to help someone who is wheelchair bound is staggering - a new van had to be purchased, ramps for the house, retrofitting the bed and the bathroom to be handicap accessible, everything.  The cost of all of Lane's medicine is INSANE, costing he and Sharon over $2,000/month out of pocket (in addition to what is covered by Medicare).  The bills...the bills just won't stop.  His wife, who has dedicated her life to their family, must care for him 24/7, so she can't even take on work  And the system, the system he has worked so tirelessly to defend, can't help him.  So if you know Lane Bailey, you know this treasure of a human is sad.  He's defeated, he's lost, he's suffering, he's depressed, he and his wife are in a serious financial bind, and neither Lane or Sharon see light at this end of this tunnel.  Any help you could provide would be beyond generous of you and so appreciated it won't even be able to be expressed appropriately.  We don't know what else to do.  He and Sharon don't even know we're asking (and are most likely going to be mad when they find out). We don't know how to pay for all of this or even how to sustain it moving forward. It's awful, just so awful. Thank you for even taking the time to read his story and for even considering donating your hard earned money to this man. Just thank you.  All our Love,Megan (Lane's daughter-in-law), Andrew (Lane's son), Waverly & Bexley (Lane's special granddaughters).----------------------------------------For More Information on MSA:https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Multiple-System-AtrophyTo Donate to the MSA Coalition: https://www.multiplesystematrophy.org","August 29, 2018","$44,180","$7,500 "
Zak Jaques ,"Raised £175 from 8 donationsGuildford, South East England, United Kingdom","Creative Arts, Music & Film","Homelessness effects every region of the UK.After spending a year living in East London, I have come to discover the sheer scope of the homeless problem we face as a society. Specifically, in the Stratford area you could find over 100 people making the shopping centre their home for the night. Putting down cardboard and rolling out sleeping bags. It isn’t safe. It isn’t right.1 in 25 people in Newham, London are currently homeless (BBC News).But it’s not just London. Countrywide, homelessness has affected thousands and is only getting worse. Yet the stigma and negative stereotypes still remain. I want to do my part in helping end homelessness. However little it may be.That’s why I’m creating a short film delving into what it is like to be homeless.Back in October I met a man named Andrew Fraser (middle). He, like many others, has spent a large proportion of his life living on the streets. Andrew, emotionally scarred yet maintaining a unique sense of humour, recalls his time living on the streets of East London with other rough sleepers. He mentioned the bitter lows and the coping mechanisms he had that got him through those dark days.The Film is led by Andrew's own words to describe what it is genuinely like.The Docu-Drama will be 10-15 minutes long. Starting in the Stratford Centre, we follow Andrew through a typical day as he, in his own words ‘asks for help’.The production is managed by Final year Film and Video Production Technology students at The University of Surrey as part of our Final Creative Project.As we are a student run project, we are currently running from a zero budget. As production comes round, expenses for us (locations, paying actors,  props etc) will increase tenfold. With your help you will be contributing to funding a project which will promote homelessness awareness and promote a change of perspective around the topic.We ask for any size donation, big or small to help fund the project. And any excess we don’t spend on the project will be donated to a charity of Andrew’s choice. So you will be helping the most vulnerable people!We start shooting at the end of January 2020.Thank you, Zak Jaques (Director/Producer)","December 20, 2019",£705,"£1,500 "
Joanne Egginton ,"Burlington, ON",Community & Neighbors,"As many of you know, two years ago today, March 12, 2013, my son Andrew, tragically passed away. Maple Skate Park in Burlington was a haven for Andrew. He'd meet friends, some of whom became lifelong friends, spending hours perfecting his tricks and just hanging out. There was an unwritten rule at Maple that ensured all were welcomed. There was no judging, ridiculing or bullying. Andrew brought a number of kids there, after spending time one on one with them, teaching them the basics of skateboarding. These kids were typically kids that were being bullied and they had somehow found their way to Andrew. The kids realized that they were not alone, that Andrew had their back and they found comfort in the fact that an older kid completely understood their plight as few others could.I think my daughter Siobhan captured the essence of Andrew in her letter to support the improvements and skate features at Maple Skate Park as a tribute to Andrew when she wrote:""Andrew McKay was my big brother. Andrew was a brother first and character second. It never ceased to amaze me the sheer number of people that knew ""McKay"".  Upon meeting people, from all over Burlington, in different scenarios, contexts and groups, I would always find myself standing with someone who knew him, but never just a little bit; they would know intimate details about his life and personality and have a funny story to tell which would usually end in ""I love that guy"". I always knew Andrew had an ability to affect people and influence them through even just one interaction, but it was so familiar to me, I never realized how special it really was. I continue to meet people today who share the most lovely memories of Andrew; how they would see him at Maple inevitably every time they went. I think of my neighbour's child who used to knock on the door to see if Andrew could come out to teach him some tricks. Andrew had visions of opening his own skateboarding program. He knew what an important and integral role Maple park had in his life and wanted to share his passion with others"". Some of you may not be aware that Andrew was a target of some horrific bullying for a number of years. My hope is that by maintaining  Maple Skate Park, we will preserve a refuge for kids who are dealing with the same issues. It will provide solace for all of us who knew Andrew,  knowing some good will come from the things he endured.  Andrew represents more than just a person; his legacy represents an idea of community and bringing people from all social circles together. His legacy represents an idea that older people should take  responsibility for the youth and their experiences. I don't know if you will ever meet another person like Andrew, someone who, just by knowing him could give you the key to a room full of people.Andrew would never have imagined this conversation surrounding improvements to Maple being  a Tribute to him. He was much too humble for that, however it is not for Andrew, it is for the people who remember Andrew and what he stood for.To that end, his family, friends and I are committed to improving the park to keep it a safe haven and a place where respect, mentoring and camaraderie can always be found. With the help of  community,  the DeGroote  Foundation For Kids, the City of Burlington,  the ""Maple Tribute Project""  will be renovating Maple Skate Park and adding two new features. One of the features will have a plaque with a dedication to Andrew, the ""Kids Help Phone"" and ""Suicide Prevention"" telephone numbers on it.We will be raising $10,000 towards the project. Donations to ""The Maple Tribute Project"" can be made on gofundme.com, or at any TD branch.  We're hoping to get 500 donations of  $20.00. If you can help by donating (any amount ...no donation is too small!) or if you can help get the word out by sharing Andrews story via word of mouth or social media, we would be so grateful.  You have our heartfelt thanks for helping to make this dream a reality.Joanne McKay","March 12, 2015","$10,120","$10,000 "
Betty Varga ,"Milwaukee, WI","Medical, Illness & Healing","Danny and Sue Tucker’s “Cancer Train Wreck Fight"" Sue has the Lung Cancer but it is a family fight! The fight has been both Emotionally and Financially Draining! A GoFundMe account has been set up to help alleviate the financial stress for Sue and Danny that the Mounting Medical Costs of Fighting Cancer entails. Their lives have derailed and need to get back on track!!Please read Sue’s Story!Sue (McLemore) Tucker is my younger 59 year old sister who will turn 60 on June 5, 2017. She lives in Columbus, MS with her husband, Danny, a retired railroad employee, and one of their sons, Stephen.  Another son, Andrew and his wife, Leanne, & family live nearby.  Sue is battling lung cancer which originally occurred 13 years ago (2004). At that time, she had her upper right lobe removed and was in remission for 10 years. Three years ago in 2014, the cancer recurred in her lower right lobe. Surgery was not an option. She was treated with chemo and radiation all while continuing to work at CECO in Human Resources. The fatigue almost did her in, but with sheer determination, she got through it. A PET scan showed she was in remission until 6 months later a CAT scan revealed the cancer had spread into the left lung. At this time, she also was diagnosed with COPD & Emphysema. The doctors offered her continuous maintenance chemo every  2 weeks to keep the cancer at bay as long as possible. Eventually, the doctors administered Opdivo, a targeted immune intravenous drug which aids the immune system to fight the cancer. At this point, she was still working because she is the sole provider of the family’s health insurance, but her 401k is nearly depleted. As of June 2016, she had used up all of her sick days and PTO days for the rest of the year.  She couldn’t afford to take any days off to just rest and recuperate. Even though the medical bills kept mounting, she managed to keep afloat. Her excellent credit rating was the one and only thing she had left that she had control of and she was determined to keep that intact and to maintain the needed health insurance. The challenges kept coming. The Central A/C in her home stopped working. For someone living in the Deep South with Lung Cancer, COPD & Emphysema, heat and humidity make it extremely difficult to breathe especially without an air conditioning system. It was an unexpected, very expensive item that had to be replaced- paid for with money they did not have! But true to Sue’s nature, even through all that she had endured, she maintained a positive, upbeat outlook on life and continued to see the best in everyone and every situation. She had faith that things would work out.  Unfortunately on September 27, 2016, a CAT scan showed that the Opdivo treatments had stopped working.There was one more option left to try. On October 17, 2016, Sue started a new regimen of a chemo drug called Taxotere. Always a tiny person, this drug was the strongest and harshest on her now 91 lb body. For the first time, through all her treatments, she finally lost her hair, lost all her fingernails, developed painful dry eye, experienced swelling, burning, redness, peeling and neuropathy of her feet making it impossible to walk, redness and peeling of hands, ulcers in the mouth, compounded by ever increasing fatigue and the struggle to breathe caused by her Lung Cancer, COPD & Emphysema. The weight loss continued!Because of the insufficient flow of oxygen throughout her body, Sue’s breathing is labored and brings on anxiety attacks which further exasperates her breathing. Imagine trying to “breathe” and you CAN’T ! Very frightening!  It is taxing and tiring on her entire body. Sometimes, it is all Sue can do to just take a shower without sitting down on the tub to rest. I don’t think people really know what it is like to go through this unless they have gone through this!The Taxotere Chemo took its toll. Sue reluctantly took 6 month Short Term Disability starting in October  2016. Through all of this, Danny took over--took over the cooking, household chores, and taking care of Sue until he himself suffered an eye injury. The ophthalmologist in Columbus referred him to a specialist in Birmingham, AL. Upon examination, the doctors determined that surgery was necessary. The surgery included several procedures in a single surgery to try and save his eyesight. They treated the eye for infection, extracted a piece of metal, reattached a detached retina, & took out the lens of his eye.  After returning home, he was instructed to lie on his side for 2 weeks 24 hours a day. He is still waiting for reimplantation of the lens. I couldn’t imagine how they would manage by themselves.  True to form, Sue said, “2 halves make a whole. We’ll manage.” And they did, without help from anyone else.Danny is still waiting to “see” if he will have vision in his eye. This procedure costs $6000 out of pocket plus meds.  Another, unexpected expense!Sue’s last treatment of Taxotere was February 1, 2017. Her insurance will terminate on April 17, 2017 if she does not return to work.Her doctor appointment on March 20, 2017 shattered her hopes of returning to work.  Her declining weight loss, her increasing labored breathing, and extreme fatigue were major concerns for the doctor. He and Sue agreed the best course of action would be to apply for Long Term Disability which means a lot less in income and no insurance if she can’t pay the extremely expensive ($1350 a mo) Family COBRA premium. It is imperative that she maintains her insurance for the total 18 month Cobra duration. She is too young for Medicare. During the Long Term Disability period, she will then be eligible to apply for Social Security Disability.All the treatments, Meds, MRI's & CAT scans she has undergone plus everyday living expenses has been extremely expensive and financially and emotionally exhausting. With the addition of Danny’s medical costs and other unexpected expenses, Sue and Danny are now financially depleted of funds.The friends, family and co-workers of both Sue & Danny know they are the most giving couple alive.  Now, it is time for them to be the “Receivers”.  Sue has always been a “Giver” to her family and her work family. Whenever in financial need, Sue would always find a way to provide for the needs of the family. Before her previous job was eliminated, she was Human Resources Rep at CECO and she encouraged   the “Open Door Policy”.  Employees would see her as someone they could come to and confide in with their problems. She listened, comforted and offered solutions. In her own family, she is still giving-sometimes at the expense of her own health.  Anyone who knows Danny, knows he would “Give” the shirt off his back to help anyone who is in need. He unselfishly has used his creative building and cooking skills to aid family members, ex- Railroad co-workers and friends- expecting nothing in return.If either of them has touched your life in a positive way, I am asking for your financial support by donating to their GoFundMe account to give them peace of mind and soul by eliminating their financial worry. With your help, we can do this. If a donation is not possible, please support them with your prayers or sending a card, an e-mail or Facebook message with words of encouragement.

Matt Thomas ,"Raised $95 from 3 donationsNew Gisborne, VIC","Creative Arts, Music & Film","Meet the brains behind the film and what it's all about  About the film: ‘Meantime’ is based on a group of teenagers all growing up together in the country Victoria. The film is set during the period in which the group have graduated high school, and are completely unsure of where they are heading to next. The film is seen from the point of view of a young woman named Isa who watches her friends slowly burn themselves out with the sheer boredom of living in rural Australia. Isa falls victim to her friends and the ways they decide to kill their time, and yet she doesn’t realise that the actions she has taken and that have been taken upon her, will shape her future forever. This story highlights the emotional isolation that comes with growing up and not knowing who you are and not having the room to experiment with that in such a small community. Why this film is important: This film is for the young Australian’s who feel their stories are not being told. We hope that this inspires other young teens who are stuck in between the fragile moments of being a child and becoming an adult. We hope to educate people around these kids who may not know what it's like to begin the journey of self-discovery. Your donations really count Every donation made will go straight towards the pre-production, Production and post-production expenses. We want to do this story justice, and to make a great Film takes great resources. Every donation big or small will help us greatly!

My home which recently broken into and vandalized. Many of my parents Momentos were taken. Although I cannot get them back, I am trying to save the rest of my belongings. I am currently disabled and you not have enough money to pay for a lawyer to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy for me. I am under the gun date wise, the sheriff sale is set for December 2. However, the lawyer has told me there is still hope.I may even be able to keep my home. I have been living through the kindness of friends, from house to house due to the fact that all of my utilities have been shut off. This bankruptcy will give me a chance to start over. Even though this is very hard for me to ask, anyone who knows me knows that if I could I would do the same in return. Depression and illness has caused me to leave it up to fate, but now I need help and I am requesting it from you. Any contribution would be deeply appreciated. Thank you in advance for all your help and kindness.                        ","November 29, 2014","$2,115","$2,300 "

Lynn Gillette ,"Sioux Falls, SD","Medical, Illness & Healing","Prayer Warriors, UNITE! Andrew, a fun-loving 8th grade student from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, knows how to make his friends and family laugh with his quick wit and humor. His positivity has proven time and time again to be a blessing to others, and a source of strength for himself. This amazing young man was born with a condition known as Goldenhar's Syndrome. Tetrology of Fallot is the name of the heart condition Andrew has which is often found in children with this syndrome. At just four months old, Andrew had open heart surgery to widen his pulmonary artery and patch a hole in his heart. Then at the age of five, he had heart surgery to replace the valve and conduit, the tube connecting the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle. Five years later, at the age of 10, Andrew had to endure a third surgery to replace this same valve and conduit. At that time, Andrew and his family were told that the valve should last until Andrew is between 18 and 19 years old. Recently, however, Andrew and his family learned that the valve is not doing its job, and Andrew will need to have yet another procedure in Minneapolis on May 27, 2015, to repair the valve. Andrew is remaining very positive and, once again, being amazingly strong! However, things are going to be very, very different this time. Mark, Andrew’s dad, was always the last one to walk Andrew back before each and every surgery; and, Mark was also the one to cheer up Andrew during the long road to recovery. Tragically, Mark will not be able to be with Andrew in the physical world, as Mark passed away last summer. Prayer warriors, this makes it all the more important that we rally together for Andrew; his mom, Jenny; his brother, Carter; and his sister, Ellie, in a HUGE showing of support and love. Thank you for enveloping Andrew and his family in prayers, love, and financial support as they endure this journey without Mark. The prayers and encouraging messages will provide them emotional and spiritual support; while the funds will help lighten the load of medical bills and travel expenses for the multiple trips to Minneapolis.Let our love be their strength! We will update this site as Andrew perseveres through this procedure and recovery. Thank you for leaving messages of encouragement for Andrew and his family!","April 1, 2015","5,495 $","25,000 $ "

                    LIFE IS FOR LIVING

     For those of you that know me, hello friends! For those of you that don't, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Sarah. More importantly, I would like to introduce you to the most beautiful person I have ever met, inside and out, Alicia Bertine. In the late summer of last year, 2015, I was at the Oncology Department of Penn Presbyterian, when Alicia walked in for her appointment as well. She had an aura about her that you could not help but be drawn to, and an awesome haircut that was bright red, and deserved a compliment! We struck up a conversation from there, and wound up having our infusion appointments at the same time. For the next few hours, sitting side by side, we got our infusions, shared a brownie, became the best of friends instantly, vowed our support for eachothers' battles, and the rest is history! 
     

     For those of you that have not been fortunate enough to meet Alicia, words will never truly do her justice when trying to describe who she is. Alicia is beautiful, strong, uplifting, generous, courageous, miraculous....and every other positive adjective that has ever existed. I am asking for your help today, to give Alicia a financial boost to make it through this very difficult time in her life. She has always been a pillar of strength and inspiration to so many people, and deserves any help that we can offer her at this time. 
     




     April 2nd is her 8 year Survivor Anniversary. She has fought Pancreatic Cancer for so long, not to mention all of the other medical issues that have occurred alongside her cancer. It is her strong faith, her friends, her loving boyfriend Andres, and her sheer will to live that has helped her to this point. She has helped countless others in waging the war against Pancreatic Cancer, and she deserves any and all the help that we could give her!
     To give you the a better picture of her current battles, I am sharing with you a bit of her story, in her own words, so you can see what this amazing woman fights with on a daily basis.

                       ALICIA'S STORY
https://www.facebook.com/alicia.bertine/videos/vb.594785266/10153359839295267/?type=2&theater 
  
   ""A month ago, I went in for a simple cancer staging PET Scan. The past 8 year's, with God's help, I have battled Ampulary into Pancreatic Cancer. The immunotherapy trial I was on at Penn, came to an end. To continue on the drug without the trial, we had to prove that the cancer was stable and not growing. Not only did the scan prove that, it also showed that I had two spots light up on my brain. That was a COMPLETE SHOCK. My Oncologist called right away to advise that I needed an emergency MRI on the brain. My boyfriend drove me straight to the hospital where I got the MRI. I was then told that I would be immediately admitted to the NICU, and have an emergency brain surgery in less than 16 hours. We didn't know what to think. To say we were upset was quite an understatement. This past month for me has been a blur. I was admitted 5 days in NICU for the brain cancer. Then just a week later, 7 days for a biliary stent issue that they tried to remove because it has caused me to be septic 8 times since the first time, and almost killed me in July 2015. Then I just had Gamma Knife Radiation on the back left part of my brain. They told me that I was healing quick. I tried to drive a couple days later, and almost flipped my car from the exhaustion of the radiation.
     This week alone, I have to be at Penn 3 different days, and have yet to secure safe transportation. I have a CT Scan, a follow-up with my GI Oncologist, and they are also going to try to remove the biliary drain....again.
     As we come up on April, my incredible boyfriend, Andres, has lost countless days of work to help take care of me. I have had home nurses, but we have had to do our own infusions of antibiotics. To make matters worse, my prescription insurance has cancelled me. I am trying so hard to get on a supplemental plan, but it is hard when i can't currently drive, and my brain feels like a crazy mess. We have had to pay out-of-pocket for loads of scripts.

                        ALICIA'S WISH
     All that I want to do is get to my little sisters wedding on April 23rd in Florida. I am supposed to be a bridesmaid and April 2nd is my 8 Year Survivor Anniversary. If you can find it in your heart to help us in any way, please do. We constantly give back and volunteer our services, and now we need all of the help that we can get. Anything will help us! 

          Thank you from the bottom 
                           of our hearts,
              Alicia Bertine & Andres

       ALICIA'S WISH - UPDATED APRIL 12, 2016
     As some of you may have noticed, we have hit our initial goal of getting Andres and I to my sisters wedding! I CANNOT THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH!!! It seriously brings me to tears knowing that I still have the support of my family and friends. For those that don't even know me, and you have given your support, you are incredible and I thank you immensely!!!
     Currently, my sister Amy's biological father has been in the hospital in serious condition for over two weeks. I HAVE TO BE THERE FOR HER. I am still weak and don't yet even have the clearance to fly to Florida. Nevermind much energy while I am still healing from the antibiotics I am finishing today. I just had 4 infections and need prayers because my temperature is still running low grade, which could mean they didn't knock out everything, or I just need some real sleep. I have been working diligently to get a new prescription plan.  I have found oneplan that I may qualify for, however, it doesn't cover all of my super strong ""Infectious Disease"" antibiotics I have to be on every time I have a biliary drain issue. These antibiotics (just one) can cost in excess of $2,000. I have been on them at least 7 to 8 times in the past year. Sometimes, it is 3 or 4 at a time.
     As you can imagine and add up, this will get really expensive since the state of New Jersey does not qualify me for more ""Extra Help.""
   PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE keep sharing, praying, and asking anyone you know to help if they can or are willing. I've got to focus on healing and fighting. Not the stress of ""what if I can't get the medicine I need to live on?!"" 
     When I say I seriously couldn't and wouldn't be able to fight like this and be alive without God, Andres, and all of my incredible family and firends....It's the truth of my life.
     I will continue to always fight for more cancer funding, awareness, and pay it forward as often as I am able!

                                           Graciously,
                                       Alicia Bertine
                                 Your Fierce AliTiger




       A THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
     
      We all know how hard it is to ask for help sometimes when we need it most. Alicia didn't ask me to help her, I asked her if I could. And in the most humble way, she accepted. I know that times are hard for so many right now, but if you could find it in your heart to donate, any and every little amount can help us get Alicia to Florida, and through some of this financial burden that has taken it's toll for nearly a decade. Alicia has so much to offer the world, and she has for so long....it's time that we, as part of her world....try to give back to her and offer her a little cushion to make life more tolerable in the financial sense right now. I have never met anyone more deserving. It is time to see that beautiful smile again through all of this pain. The ""Alicia"" smile that lights up the entire room. 

     There is only a small window of time between now and her sister's wedding on April 23rd. I am hoping we could all pull through for her by the middle of April to help her get there!!!!Thank you all so much for taking the time to help in any way that you could!!!!

Andrew had a beautiful soul and character.  His smile and infectious laugh could cheer up an entire room. Andrew served his country with the heart and courage of a lion. He was a proud American Airman. 

While on tour in Bagram Afghanistan, Andrew and his team were conducting a mission outside the perimeter of safety. Andrews vehicle ran over an IED placed on the Rd. Andrew suffered from a Tramatic Brain Injury also known as a TBI. Andrew was sent home later, where he was diagnosed with PTSD on top of the TBI. Andrew became a Purple Heart Recipient amongst another Airman injured with him in Bagram. The 20th SFS was proud of their heroic actions.

Later in Andrews career, incidents arose and leadership prevailed against him, forcing him out of the military. An Airman was left behind that day. Andrew went home to Oregon, where he resided with his family, who cared so much for him. He had a beautiful dog named Kiddy, whom he loved very much and she him. Kiddy was his companion in life. Kiddy is now residing with Andrews loving mother Lisa.

Today, we are asking for help. Taking care of Andrews finances, funeral costs, family and of course Kiddy needing the proper resources, shouldn't become a burden to his wonderful family. The loss of life is a heartache itself and we have the opportunity to help easy some of the weight of their shoulders.

Please keep the Long family in your thoughts and prayers as they lay their beloved son to rest. Rest easy Andrew.

Oliver Andrew ,"Little Kingshill, South East England, United Kingdom","Medical, Illness & Healing","Let’s talk mental health.There is a sense of fear attached to those two words- a fear of the unknown and also a fear of the stigmatisation it’s associated with. Unlike physical pain- mental pain is difficult to quantify, it’s ambiguous extremelly difficult to define as no two people face the same mental difficulties. There Isn’t a medicine one can take, nor an ointment to put on or a physio to cater to our needs. The way we have learnt to deal with mental pain is individualistic- we all deal with it differently. However some people’s coping methods are better than others. Being the perfectionist that I am Ive had my own issues with mental health and in doing so I have witnessed first hand  the adverse correlation between my own mental and physical well being. I first suffered in my final year of University. The stress of coursework and deadlines was very intense and I felt as if I was losing control of my life. The only way I felt as if I could gain some sort of control was over my eating. Strange I know- but I felt that if I moderated what I ate- by eating too healthy (and by healthy I mean eating nothing with fats or high amounts of salt in)I would feel better about myself. This took over my life- so much so that I eventually dropped down to 60kg with a BMI of only 15 (3 lower than the recommended) rate. Oblivious to how this would affect my family and friends I continued- adamnet that I was being healthy this way whilst continuingly starving myself. It got so bad that I would often collapse after a busy day, forget where I was and often fall over on campus. It was scary stuff! Unsurprisingly I was diagnosed with anorexia on November the 16th 2016. A day I wouldn’t forget. I remember not feeling bad about this title but ashamed- I felt as if it was pathetic that I a 21 year old lad had an issue with something as trivial as food. So I kept this diagnosis to myself. The day I realised I had a problem was on Christmas of that year- the only Christmas I have ever spent alone and the only one I ever plan on spending by myself.  During that one month holiday I had lied to my friends and family that I would go home and get some help.  Ashamed  of being ill and sick and scared of not having any control over what I ate I secluded myself from the rest of society and spent that month in the confinement’s of my uni flat.  I remember thinking as if I wasn’t worthy to be with anyone and that my company would bring people down.I don’t know if anyone has spent a Christmas alone- but it was awful. A time which should have been spent with cheer, festivities and the people I loved was spent isolated and on my own. My family called me that Christmas day and luckily I  answered. I could hear how saddened they were to hear their once healthy son talking about how he didn’t want to go home when I needed themthe most. This was the catalyst and motivation I needed to make a change. I changed for my family but I realised that I needed to change for my own happiness. So I got help froma councillor who I started opening up to- talking about my issues.  Together we discovered that I needed to channel a sense of control I took up running and haven’t looked back since.....So why Mind?Mind offers information on a range of topics such as:Where to get help different types of mental health Advocacy Medication There local services supported over 425,000 people struggling with mental health last year. They provide centres and helplines for people that are struggling. My advice would be if he if you were struggling to call one of the helplines.

We hope that these purchases along with the lights we have already will help to spread joy and some Christmas spirit, not only this Christmas but for many Christmases to come. But responsibility of this scale, doesn't come cheap and we need your help once again. We are aiming to raise £10,000 to fund the purchase, assembly and maintenance of the lights. Believe us, we know this is a lot of money and without the help of some extremely generous individuals and businesses within the town we wouldn't have been able to achieve half of what we have so far, and for that we'd like to say thank you, but it doesn't and shouldn't stop here. In collaboration with local ward Councillors from Aberavon and Port Talbot, we are seeking to raise as much money as possible. Our town, like every town needs Christmas lights and cheer, so please support our campaign in ANY way you can by donating via this OFFICIAL GoFundMe page.

Not good. We are quite possibly on the last legs of Canadian values. We have a ""leader"" who is dead set on changing our identity completely.All of our nations establishment political parties have no plans on changing the direction we are headed. Only the People's Party of Canada does. It does not seem as though the PPC has much of a chance of getting into the position to make those changes though. Why? Because their exposure is minimal and the Left wing controlled mainstream media will never give them any fair or honest coverage.So, what can we do to change that? Well, each of us must give and do what we as single individuals are able to give and do. We are the ""People"" in People's Party after all.For me personally, it is film work. Film work that can expose what the party is all about to citizens.I reached out to Maxime Bernier (Head of the PPC) on Twitter and offered my services to the party. The individual who manages his social media account responded that they just do not have the funds at this time to hire me. Which is understandable because they are still a new up and coming party.So I have decided that I want to make a documentary. I want this to be a good documentary that people can watch and give credibility to, and that just can't be done with no money.So I am looking to get $20,000 for it.I am well aware that $20,000 is absolute peanuts when it comes to film making. But I am just looking for the bare minimum possible. I do know that even getting this amount has a very small chance of happening because everybody is going through very rough times in this country right now, including myself. Damn, it's the reason we're all so fed up with the way things are, isn't it?I want to make clear that this would be a completely independent project and is not an authorized project by the PPC. It will be done from my own individual purview, which will make it better and a lot more credible if you ask me. Not propagandist driven.I also want to make sure everyone knows that this will not be a project to make profit with. I feel the need  to do whatever I can to open Canadian's eyes up and have them realize the only common sense platform there is to insure them, their children and their grandchildren have a decent future in this country.So this documentary will be uploaded free for everybody to see and share on every platform. Some of the issues I would tackle in this documentary are:- How & why the PPC came to fruition- Exposing Justin Trudeau's blatant corruption and how his government is giving Canada completely away-Immigration - The United Nation's stronghold over our CountryBut most importantly...-Going in depth and explaining what the policies on each parties platform actually mean. A lot of people (I'd say most people actually) vote with blindness to what anything they are voting for even means. They watch the mainstream media and choose who's voice they like more when hitting talking points on issues that mean absolutely nothing at all.For example, the thing that stuck out most to me about the PPC platform was the abolishment of the Capital Gains Tax.I guarantee you, you can ask 50 people what the Capital Gains Tax is and at least 35 of them won't have a single clue about it.There are many other things to cover as well, I am just giving a brief rundown.If the money can be raised, here is what it would go towards,- Transportation & low cost motel's if interviews can be garnered in different cities with certain people. (People running for MP positions in different ridings, PPC Members, Experts on the different issues we would be covering, and hopefully if it could be possible, Maxime Bernier himself)- Minimal equipment rentals- Help with different aspects of the production- If anything leftover, Money for myself to live with as this would take a big chunk of my life, both time wise and work wise. I want to thank everybody for even reading this far.If this money can be generated by mid March I will immediately begin production.If it can't be, that is completely understandable, as I said, I'm aware it is rough times for everybody these days.If somehow even more than the $20,000 I am asking for is raised, That would give me more to work with for the project and would literally be life changing for myself.Thanks A lot everybody,- Gregg Purcell (A.K.A Gordon Burling) ","February 13, 2020",$645,"$20,000 "
Alaa Al Soufi ,"York, ON",Other,"On September 29 I attended a  Maxime Bernier and PPC rally I was protesting in Mohawk College in Hamilton. As a result of participating in this rally me and family were subjected to an overwhelming amount of hateful messages and death threats which caused us a great deal of stress and trauma and very recently has it began to die down. On October 23 I was charged by Hamilton PD with 2 counts of intimidation, 2 counts of disguised of intent and disturbing the peace. Hamilton PD’s decision to press charges has reopened this trauma and caused us to experience additional hate.I ask the Canadian community for help in fighting these charges as the legal fees are quite substantial and it is important to band together and show that Canada is an inclusive place for all nationalities and religions and hate has no place here","November 1, 2019","$5,047","$15,000 "
Lynn Johnson ,"Oxbow, SK","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","""A PLACE FOR ALL"" and an  ""AMAZING PLACE"" it will be!!!This funding site is being updated as of today Wednesday, February 27, 2019 because I wish to broaden the scope of my call for funding. There is a Federal Election this fall in Canada. Due to this if I receive enough in donations to afford to, it is my every intention to run for member of parliament as an independent candidate.I have supported and voted for various parties provincially and federally in the past . All parties have their strong points, all parties have their frailties and short comings.I agree with Trudeau and the Liberals that a strong middle class is key to a strong stable economy, and I also agree that the Harper Conservatives were treacherous and divisive in their negative approach to politics and so I tend not to follow their example much. Rt. Hon. Joe Clark never became a Conservative but chose to remain a Progressive Conservative which I find to be a far more palatable political approach for conservative politics. Maxime Bernier has recently started a Conservative off shoot party called the People's Party which is a resurrection of the Progressive Conservative party. I may decide to align part of my independent platform with that of the People's Party over time as we find out more about them. I do contend that the presence of a progressive conservative party is a good thing to have in Canadian politics again. Welcome back Maxine Bernier et al.I also feel the Green Party has some relevant positions on environmental and social issues which bear consideration when running a country and deciding what's best. Their leader, Elizabeth May sets a very good example of a deliberate attempt in the over all picture of Canadian politics of a cooperative and constructive interaction with other parties and their affairs. She sets a good example of how politicians should attempt to interact on a day to day interparty basis.The NDP under Jack Layton were a party that championed the little guy, and the thought of inclusiveness and acceptance of others. For the most part that is a fairly good position to maintain. The NDP also has it's concerns with social programs and structure.Again they have their good points and their bad but definitely have issues, ideas and perspectives to be considered when running this country.You may want to know what my thoughts are on the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana last Oct. 17, 2018. Let's just say, ""If you can't keep off the grass, just mow the lawn when necessary."" LOLMedical marijuana has it's many merits and benefits and as far as what people choose to do is really their own business as long as there's no harm to others.So I want to run for Parliament this fall, so please help fund my campaign. I ran for Parliament in 1984 when I was 28 years old as a Rt. Hon. John Turner Liberal. He wasn't crazy about free trade and risking becoming an economic trading colony and economic puppet of the USA and neither was I.I was not successful in my efforts and withdrew my candidacy prior to the nomination meeting. This was so I wouldn't split the vote and risk having a more qualified candidate miss out and lose the nomination.It is over 30 years later and I feel qualified for this job now.So please read my entry in it's entirety, donate to my cause and vote for me this fall as an Independent candidate for Parliament. As a independent I can speak my mind, say the things that should be said, and not be muzzled to tow some misguided party line in some cases.So enjoy the rest of my entry. Donate to my campaign and cause, get in touch to volunteer to be part of the campaign team if you like and see you on the campaign trail. If I raise adequate enough funds to finance the campaign in time.Why should you donate? With the economy in our area as slow as it is as a result of the low price of oil if I am elected I'd have a job again and I would have a definite appreciation of it and would serve this constancy well and from a grassroots approach.I intend to represent the constituency of Qu’Appelle-Moose Mountain, with the position of taking what's best from all parties and what makes the most pragmatic sense, as opposed to being stuck with some old outdated party mantra or belief. I will represent the voices and concerns and best interests of my constituency first as apposed to towing some external party line interest. This I can do as an independent M.P.As far as political experience I have some to call on from my past and I've been governor of my own independent state of mind all my life. LolJoin the effort, join the campaign, volunteer if you like. The main priority is that we do some good as a result, enjoy the task at hand and of course have some constructive fun.So read the rest of my entry and find out who you might want to vote for this fall in the Federal election. Enjoy!Pre-Amble to the Main Entry called ""Amazing Place""The content in the main entry entitled ""Amazing Place"" may be in the eyes of many readers something that sounds far-fetched perhaps, maybe even something to read in a tongue-in-cheek frame of mind.""Amazing Place"" is about a regional real estate, spiritual, resort, entertainment, educational development concept that had been conceptualized close to 40 years ago. This concept had been put together by myself, Lynn Johnson, and a few key blue-chip developers. At the time of conception (the early 80's) Grant Devine was the Premier of the Province of Saskatchewan and his deputy premier was Eric Berntson. He was also the MLA for the Souris-Cannington constituency in the extreme S.E. corner of the province.It was the fifth year of their first term of mandate the P.C. gov't had to call an election in the spring of 1987. Some of these blue chip notables and some key P.C. members were lining up about $225 million in 1987 dollar value behind me to run against Eric Berntson.First, because they felt I had been well connected in my blue-chip careers thus far, that and as well, because they didn't want to vote for Eric Berntson again. Why? Recent to the impending election call Eric Berntson was in the news for alleged improprieties to his adopted teenage daughter. The next thing you know people are wanting me to run against him. But before we could get a campaign under way his adopted daughter gets thrown in a mental hospital and three of Eric Berntson's closest political associates trump up 3 criminal charges on me. As a matter of some incorrect paperwork and a paper-shuffle I was unable to defend myself and have the charges defended in court because before you knew it, I was thrown in a mental hospital too. Several years later I found out from a lawyer that there was a very notable misdelegation of due process that had me thrown in a mental hospital so I couldn't run against Eric Berntson.After his re-election and subsequent promotion to a federal Senator under their Rt.Hon. Brian Mulroney, he eventually had justice catch up with him hence he served time in jail on fraud charges to do with political pay-offs and influence-peddling and the like.Eris Berntson was known to be a crude, vulgar at times, populist bully who never was on the up and up.Back to my charges and the trip to the mental hospital I got railroaded and diagnosed as a schizophrenic by a doctor whose hospital was receiving millions of dollars as a result of Eric Berntson's gov't. Yes I was railroaded by a complicit psychiatrist who was part of Berntson's political takedown of me.I wasn't hearing voices and I hadn't ever been. That's part of a schizophrenic diagnoses. As well as not hearing voices I displayed none of the other characteristics that went along with the complicit and corrupt psychiatrist's diagnoses of me.After I got out of the hospital my phone had stopped ringing for my busy little business. The horrible medications they forced me to take for a gross misdiagnosis were debilitating and mental disorientating.As a result, instead of continuing on with a burgeoning and successful business and political career in my late 20's I got forced onto a disability pension and fell out of touch with my crowd of business associates.So ""Amazing Place"" and all the economic diversity that had been planned for S.E. Sask never happened because the people involved didn't want to have anything to do with Eric Berntson's vision for S.E. Sask. His view was to build up the oil industry at the benefit of his tight little club and everyone else go fend for themselves. A short-sighted view of a red-neck, bully, populist.In the years since 1987 when I was taken out, life has been a struggle because of the stigma attached of being a mentally ill person. A misdiagnosis if there ever was one. I have busied myself in the years since 1987 as a sales rep, a bit of consulting on business projects, public relations roles for numerous clients in recent years and doing carpentry and construction projects.But I never gave up on the hopes of making Amazing Place a reality someday.Political dirty tricks by Eric Berntson back in 1987 prevented it from happening back then. However Eric Berntson passed away on September 23, 2018 and now that his band of cronies no longer have a need to protect their beloved Eric anymore I'm putting forth this crowdfunding campaign again, called ""Amazing Place""I never had the chance to run for MLA in 1987 because of Eric Berntson's dirty tricks to protect against his alleged improprieties to his adopted daughter and numerous other things.So if anyone would like to see ""Amazing Place"" become a reality, if you would like to be part of a moment of letting the people in general decide as opposed to a corrupt few then please donate. There was international interest in the project and Berntson knew I would've beat him election day. Instead, he peddled influence, trumped up charges and had his daughter and then I systematically thrown in mental hospitals to cover up his dirty laundry.So if you want to be part of a grass roots movement, where you can be part of a movement and a project that is of benefit to everyone, not just an elitist few industrialist corporation's and individuals, then donate to ""Amazing Place""I'm looking for volunteers and manpower and when it's built it will be how the people want it done, at a grass roots level not just a vision of some select self-serving elitist few.Yes you will find things a little in question in the remainder of this entry called ""Amazing Place"" however I decided I would try for some controversy.For years I have lived under the restrictions of the mental health act and all the ridiculous red-tape of it all. A system where the professionals involved are bent on keeping patients rather than giving them a clean bill of health because that reduces their case-load which reduces their income. Yes a corrupt system, but I'll address that some other time.So being a resourceful sort and turning a negative into a positive for the benefit of everyone, here's what's going on in ""Amazing Place"".The system was bent on putting a ""mental"" diagnosis on me, when it was nothing more or less that a dirty political cover-up.Therefore if the system is bent on calling me crazy for the sake of their self-serving job security then lets work with that. Let's use it to our advantage as a drawing card and a curiosity item as you encourage others to visit this ""Amazing Place"" page.If there's going to be a ""mental"" aspect to it then do it to our advantage for the news worthiness and controversy.In the following pages there will be a rather glib but responsible claim to possibly being the second coming of Christ. I no more think that of myself than any other Christian.The second coming of Christ is the collective uplifting of love in everyone’s hearts. The definition of Christ is: the divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all mankind.There for no man or woman who has Christ in their heart is anymore or less important than the next or the other.So if you want to see ""Amazing Place"" built as it would've been some 35-40 years ago except for being stopped to protect a crooked and questionable political career, then donate.You’ll come to a sentence where it says I had a deadline to raise some $800,000 for the property. The deadline doesn't apply anymore. The land is being held for me.I'm looking for donations, investment and fundraisers. If anyone out there raises funds for me I'll give 10 -15% back to the fundraisers in commission.Be part of a grassroots movement where the people decide. Read and decide whether someone with a ""mental"" issue could've written ""Amazing Place"" or not. If you decide I deserve a chance to build the project then donate and bring others to the site as well. Perhaps we'll have a vital and viral campaign as our success.Eric Berntson died on Sept 23/2018. He put my life on hold in the spring of 1987 and cut short some life’s dreams of mine and others at that time. These many years later, I hope to build ""Amazing Place"" and make the economic development plan come about again for the people of S.E. Sask. There's more to building a economy than to focus on just resource based industry. There's trade, manufacturing, secondary education, entertainment, the arts and tourism a true diversity of potential that has been most sorrowfully ignored these last 40 years and are needed here more than ever. Needed to provide jobs so people have more of a choice for a livelihood other than moving away to a city and watch small-town Saskatchewan just get smaller.Donate to this movement.Donate to this cause.I've been capable of building this project for 35 - 40 years. Now it's time to get on with it.So now if you get on with reading ""Amazing Place"" and help in whatever way you can it will be greatly appreciated. Let's leave something to benefit people for generations to come. God BlessSo what do you think? Should we have an ""Amazing Place"" to benefit the world and a sustainable future, in a world of peace and peaceful coexistence.I think so. I've brought the idea up again after close to a 40 year delay. Let's get us back somewhat to a time and a world and headspace that wasn't bent on war and conflict but rather on hope and interactional development and cooperation.A time of Harmony, somewhat.Thank you for reading this.Thank you for realizing I can't do it by myself and donating to the cause.And without further adieu read my original entry entitled ""Amazing Place"" Enjoy!I open this funding page with a quote by Charles Herbert Spencer - 18th Century scientist and philosopher.""There is a principal in life which is a bar against all informationWhich can be used as proof against all argumentsAnd cannot fail to lead to a life of everlasting ignoranceThat principal is contempt, prior to investigation""As you read the rest of this funding request read it through to the end. At the end of it only determines whether you have contempt or consideration for it. Also at the end consider if there is value for the money from what you got out of it by reading it.Either in entertainment, intrigue, value or sense of purpose by donating. If you see a value gained then donate and fund this page accordingly.Hello! My name is Lynn & Thank you for coming to my crowd funding proposal called ""Amazing Place"", which is to be a real estate, cultural, educational, religious, recreational, entertainment and organic farm development.People want value for their money. That being said if you would like to base the size of your donation on value you get out of reading at this site, be it $2, $5, $10, or whatever amount, if nothing else base it on the worth value you get from the Poem that is written at the end of this entry. It is a poem of insight and unique perspective that allows one to feel right about oneself in their day-to-day. A reward to you for reading this entry in its entirety. So if Amazing Place gets the millions of dollars from this site at $2, or $10 or whatever at a time, then that will be the case and with the Peace of Mind that all donors got value for their money.That being said please also refer to the Glen Ewen General Store which gives a bit more on my background and related experience which leaves me capable of building ""Amazing Place""Why did I write this you may ask? After 62 yrs of living I just feel like having my say so and get some things off my mind. For those of you old enough to remember a well-known movie of the mid 70's called Network starring Peter Finch as Howard Beale. A news anchorman who was ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore"", that demonstrates the hidden mood of a lot of people again these days some 40 yrs later.So this is my once every 62 yrs vent of my feelings. By no means do I have any intentions of following in the footsteps of Howard Beale in the movie but by mentioning the movie, it does demonstrate some of my concerns and dissatisfactions with some aspects of the world as it is today. So therefore I propose Amazing Place as the project and solution to some of the needs this world has today and how we all can participate to be part of this project and social movement as the outcome. Please read on to the end. Remember there's a reward at the end if you do. And hopefully you will see the value for the money should you decide to contribute and participate in this project.As follows:My full name is Lionel Lynn Johnson. Born August 15th, 1955. Born in the middle of the night, middle of the month, middle of the decade, in the middle of the 20th century in the middle of the continent. I'm just a middle of road kind of guy.Middle of the road in the regard that you always have to evaluate both sides of an issue before drawing a sensible conclusion. And realize even after the point of conclusion there is still plenty of room for discussion. LOLAccording to history, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace died at the age of 33 and apparently there are clues in the Bible and from seers that 1988 was likely the year for his return to become King. August 15, my birthday was also the first day of Woodstock, the large peace festival which was held in the state of New York in 1969 which launched a great spin-off of peace initiatives in the world.Aside from being born on the same day as a day of Peace, August 15, my birth sign, Leo, is of a king, my first name, Lionel, is reference of a king, and my last name refers to a king. Johnson King John's son. Of course the King John who gave us the Magna Carta in 1215. The Initial Charter and start of Western Civilization and of the democracies we have in it's evolution.As well I am the man who would be king of one of the clans of this area. I was also 33 in 1988 when I was officially confirmed into the United Church of Canada as a member. I grew up in the United Church and upon leaving home at 18 for many years when not regularly attending church I lived the life of a gnostic. In simple terms the individual Christian voice. I kept the 10 commandments as my guide and reference as best I could and only focused on the Red Letter words of Christ in the Bible (KJV) as part of my sensibilities.In later years I attended the Anglican Church and now attend a private independent assembly of worshipers and believers. As a result of my association with the United and Anglican churches for many years I also support the Universal Catholic assembly. As a result of my coincidental entry back to organized religion at the age of 33 in 1988 as the seers said it might happen. I wish to make note I do support the Pope.In Matthew 24 of the Bible it is said that the coming of the Lord to take power would be accompanied by a streak of light in the sky from the east to the west and that no one would know of his time of coming but the Father, perhaps not even the man himself. In the spring 1996, the comet Hyakutaki crossed from east to west in the sky for the first time in recorded history. At the same time I took power over a major continental issue being the primary voice that stopped a large toxic-waste incineration project that would have poisoned millions of people, millions of acres of farmland and water supplies. Yes I was and still can be an environmental activist.In the spring of 1997, the comet Hale-Bopp came as a streak of light from east to west for the first time in recorded history. At the same time I took power back over my life and away from the authorities. This was necessary because in opposition to the toxic waste incineration project the authorities tried to punish me for protecting the earth and its inhabitants by trying to ruin my credibility by creating lies that had me put in a Mental Hospital. This was an attempt to get the incineration project back on board for the sake of money instead of common sense. A green peace executive told me during my stay in the mental hospital ""Don't worry. You can't consider yourself a true environmental activist until you've had at least one trip to the mental hospital"" Lol. They failed and I and the planet won because the waste incinerator project got cancelled.Now where am I going with all this is not to say or claim that I might be the Second coming of Christ. I make no claim on that. I'm just putting forth these circumstances and coincidences in my life to show why I live as just a man and I live simply as a reminder that we are to live in Peace and have no reservations in accepting Jesus Christ as my savior or as an influence in predicating my actions in life.Mathew 24 says no one would know of his time of coming. Perhaps not the man himself not anyone.The true definition of Christ does not refer to the human form. It refers to the ""divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all mankind. That being said, it is my contention that perhaps the second coming of Christ for mankind is the collective uplifting of love and peace through all mankind. With reference to the book of Revelation that ""nation rise up against nation"", why should it not be shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, not fist to fist.If in fact I am he, I will not and will never know it or believe it. All I will believe is that with all the acts of war and terrorism and social unrest and difference in the world that times are getting very uncertain. So much so that leaders are logisticizing and ramping up to a nuclear world war to end North Korea's war initiative. Another unfortunate case of the tail trying to wag the dog.So I say before it's possibly too late I'd like to do my part in starting a peace initiative that others might wish to take part in.How I am going to start it is by building a rural hotel, sanctuary, healing and family retreat complex. The first phase will cost $40,000,000As far as time frame, the first $800,000 must be raised by the first of June 2018 to secure the land, and to keep things on schedule.The next phase will be the building of the lodge, the combination concert hall, meeting, congregation, wedding and worship facility and the private cabins which will be situated around the central facility.Also there will be plans for riding stables and arena, an animal farm, trotting racetrack and stadium, golf course, and an organic farm corporation.The theme will be of a country retreat. Where people can listen to country and western performances and a traditional approach to life. There will be area farms participating, so that people can go out on hayrides, camp fires, ride a tractor or a combine and show the kids some of the rural life with bus tours and car rides in the country. That is of course when they aren't in the pool or on the water slides or being taken to the local skating rink in the winter.It will be a place where all are welcome and hosted for all their many needs. As far as the healing aspect people will be able to come for natural healing by qualified practitioners.For myself I provide products from: Anovite.com/superfood. Where you can find the #1 rated most nutritionally dense and complete food supplement on the planet. This ancient superfood has been known as ""the promise of life"" for centuries. This line of colostrum, corrects a condition in the body that is an affliction 85% of the population. When the affliction is corrected it provides all the building and constituents blocks and stem cell production for the body to correct and to help heal over 400 known autoimmune disorders. Be they mental, arthritis, MS, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, fatigue, stress, heart disease, blockages, cholesterol, fibromyalgia, weight control and much more.Scientific research concludes with the proper nutrition and environment a human should live to a 130 years of age and older. This product reverses aging and is the proper nutrition to extend a healthy life years beyond what one might expect.So there you have it. I want Peace and Peaceful Coexistence to come back to this world and my rural Hotel/Resort will be the model of this ""world community village we strived for after WW11. The war to end all wars supposedly. Now we've been ramping up since 9/11 and after 17 yrs of the struggle against terrorism it almost looks like the terrorist have already won by the turmoil the world is in. I want to build a sustainable meeting, holiday, healing center that is based on an old mantra of decades ago when I was young, an attempt to re-visit the "" world community village"" that my generation strived for in our youth.Unfortunately forces have taken the world away from that time and it's time to bring it back.You may think I'm crazy or eccentric at the very least but when you listen to some of our world leaders ramping up for world war and nuclear confrontation maybe we should all call for peace and do our part to participate in my particular supposed craziness.What if every person in the world decided to forgive and forget and woke up tomorrow in a non combative frame of mind. No need for war or terrorism and the world would be at Peace. It's as simple as everyone stop fighting and show tolerance for our differences not animosity. It's that simple. We could spend our time and money on technology to stop global warming and on green energy infrastructure and really save the planet.However if these are the times of the revelations, lets counter it by building a Peaceful getaway out here on the prairies. And when the 144,000 of the twelve tribes of Israel get done sorting it out in the middle east we can "" invite them all over to break bread on the patio at the hotel and encourage multicultural harmony not rivalry. Perhaps people will be dancing in the streets come that day.Who knows we get one working model going and then build more. This project will be totally off the grid with wind/solar power and hydrogen generator technology. At least we'll do our part for the planet though some world leaders turn a blind eye and refuse to their part.Should you decide to help fund me, I accept it with gratitude, humility and should you come see the place some day you will be greeted, welcomed with respect and dignity. Should you decide not to help out that's ok but please do me the favor of referring others to this page and help get the word around.Recommended reading:The Celestine Prophecy - James RedfieldA Return to Love - Marianne WilliamsonBringers of the Dawn - Barbara Marciniak7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen J Covey""Imagine all the people, living life in Peace.You may say I a dreamerBut I'm not the only one.""John Lennon - The BeatlesGo in Peace Harm No One- Jesus ChristSo folks let's have a bit of fun doing this. When a person takes themselves too seriously that's when problems arise.If 10% of the Christians on the continent of North America all gave me $1.75 each I reach more than my total of $45,000,000. And if you all shared this on Facebook it could happen.If those of you who wished to participate in this project have no congregation that you attend on Sunday, perhaps you might come to this site and make a regular Sunday by Sunday donation in absence of supporting a congregation. Support the ""Amazing Place""A place built on the principles of peace, world community village, equality, and harmony.Once it is built this place of sanctuary and harmony it will embed into the rest of the world a living mantra to hopefully send it. A middle of the road kind of guy who has a sense of humor and just wants the world to lighten up a little. God knows its needed. That's why he told me to say so. Nudge nudge wink wink. My lawyers, Accountants, Architect and the like are in place and a very large hotel chain interest is in the background. Having said that the general over all theme of this development will be an attempt in appearance, character, personality of the late 50's to the late 60's. It was post war the world was relatively at peace and it was a time when the people and the land were relatively in harmony and everybody had hopes and dreams and expectations for the future. We had a strong growing middle class there was always enough to go around and people still made a point of making sure everyone was helped out. Things were still pretty traditional. Music and architecture and home life not unlike the old classic movies. There was a mood of tolerance benevolence and inspiration towards life and progress in general. People felt safe and secure whether it was with their neighbor next door or family or a stranger they met on the street. This is what we wish to embody in this development and attitude towards achieving the end goal and presentation of ""Amazing Place"".We may be able to promote other developers to join in and build something not unlike a small scaled down Branson, MissouriThe sky is the limit. It all starts with an idea.""Build it and they will come""- Field of DreamsSome might be curious about this following point about me. I live as a celibate heterosexual. Decades ago I could have said a gentleman but today no one would get it anymore and I believe that sexual intimacy and love making be between a man and a woman within the institution of marriage. It has been God's wish that marriage is between a man and a woman. Those that would want to change that to include homosexuals are going against God's wish and allowing the tail to wag the dog. Too much of that these days. Homosexuals can have recognized civil unions and be accepted as Christians but I don't approve or recognize an act of marriage between them. It's against God's wish.If you give a donation or not here's an insight that is priceless.How to acquire Peace of mind and feel God's Love:Sit back relax, a few deep breaths then passively and acceptingly feel the emotion of something loving and something beautiful and put those two feelings together.Example:A memory from your youth of being with friends or family and seeing the presents under a beautiful Christmas tree on Christmas morning. At the instant you combine the emotions of love, peace and beauty you will feel a Peace of Mind.If it's a surprise to you when the peaceful sensation happens don't become aggressive towards it because the feeling disappears. You must remain passive and patiently accepting for the feeling of Peace to stay. It takes practice to master it so you can have Peace of Mind all the time.Another insight:Reality is one extreme or the other or somewhere in between. Up or down, happy or sad, good or evil, giving or taking, selfish or generous, stoic or arrogant and so on.Basic psychology only has 2 emotions Love or Fear, or rather Love going the opposite way.So a person goes to or from something in love or feel or neutrality or indifference.From these basics and predicated by the 10 commandments in interpretation a person can figure out or determine what's up or what's best about just about anything and if uncertain about the choice of actions you can use this basic system to figure things out. So with reality as between 2 extremes and with 2 basic emotions how do we exist, within that binary system.I choose to live moving forward, spiritually upward in a caring , considerate, productive and benevolent and helpful regard. All in an effort of achieving Peaceful positive synergy and harmony with the world and people around me. I feel resolved and confident in this state.My politics are similar to my driving habits. I stay close to the middle of the road but a bit off to the right (right minded as opposed to right wing) and some times I use the left lane to bypass some obstacle on the right that slows me down or makes good sense to do so. And I do contend that if you get too far to either side of the road you'll end up stuck in the ditch going no where in a hurry.It's always a case of staying centered and balanced in your determinations of what is truth and what is just and right.""Everything that exists is real""""Anything that is real need not feel fear""""There in lies the Peace of God""From the bookA course in MiraclesI might add to that ""If you feel fear where you're at then where you're at isn't real""""So move in mind or place to a place that gives you Peace.""I'm putting out a call particularly to the baby boomers to help me. Act now and join the cause so we don't become a wasted, forgotten, ineffective and insignificant generation for what we once all believed in like peaceful coexistence may all be lost if we don't remind the world again what our generation stood for or all may be lost. I think otherwise. That's why I want to make this project and frame of mind amongst all people Hopefully you do too. Let's make the difference we are supposed too. So again thank you for your time reading this and again ""Go in Peace, Harm No One""Jesus Christ""Live Long and Prosper""SpockIt maybe the devil or it may be the LordBut you're going to have to serve somebodyBob DylanI choose to serve the Lord.And yes I may be psychic because: ""I can tell by the way you're thinking about me that you don't know whether I'm the real thing or not"" LOLIf I am all I can say is I sure wish they had twin blade razors back 2000 yr ago.""Hope is the greatest antidote for fear""Let us all hope for Peace Everlasting and a sensible outcome in the affairs of this chaotic world. To all you baby boomers out there, we grew up as the generation of Peace and Love"". Let's all live it.Be the change you want to see in the world today.Mahatma GhandiThank you for getting through my some what elongated. Slip of the mind. LOLI do have the practical life expression as to make ""Amazing Place"" a reality and in the midst of all of it keep it fun, and inspirational for everyone. We take the project seriously but not too serious within the project.When you get too serious about anything it takes the versatility of the mind and the heart away to stay inspired and fulfilled in doing a good and beneficial job of anything. That being said, spread the word, create some controversy over this great mystery at hand. Will ""Amazing Place"" come to be ? Always the conundrum. Maybe this sounds a bit off beat or as a departure from the popular approach of divide and conquer, choose up sides, exploit and capitalize that goes on with others these days.Hopefully cool heads will prevail and this Amazing Place will be built in recognition that working and coming together can work instead of divide and conquer.Amazing Place, taking us back to where we should not have left bringing us in to the future with a sustainable followable path. Let's see this place built to show that nice people and their efforts don't have to necessarily finish last.""A hotel, sanctuary, healing, entertainment, vacation, sports, equestrian, place of gathering and worship. Built on the premise of equality, world community, village, love, peace, benevolence and an effort of bringing people together, not by dividing and conquering as some hotel operators would do out there, amongst other things. This project will be a success built on bringing people peacefully together, in the common good, not dividing, conquering and chaos. There will be something for everyone and at an affordable admission price.Now that we're close to the end of this account of request for help in the way of money and as to why, let me state the following:I don't really need 10's of millions to make Amazing Place become a reality. I really only need perhaps 3 million dollars. Enough to purchase the required land and the balance to promote, get marketing and design the concept and then leverage the balance of the money with in visitors participating in the long run. If the money fund raised is in an amount that exceeds the initial 3 million dollars then farm land shall be purchased to start an organic farm corporation to help feed the guests and the world in general. With decent edible food instead of the over processed, chemically doctored food we are almost obligated and forced to eat today for lack of other choice. And as far as me being the second coming, please don't take me too seriously, but take the concept of peaceful coexistence and love amongst man and woman kind is what is intended as the outcome put into the present once Amazing Place is built.Take the project seriously but don't get carried away with too much else.It's all in the name of having some hope having some fun and controversy and goodwill amongst all men as the outcome.Let Amazing Place, it's intent and process be the quantum shift the world needs.A project of bringing the world together in Peace with a common belief in harmony as opposed to the present state of divide and conquer, chaos and threat of nuclear confrontation.Let us all be light hearted and hopeful that Amazing Place soon becomes a reality. Nothing but good will be the outcome of our actions on building ""Amazing Place""Let us all enjoy the task at hand of making it happen. If any opposition to the project or myself arises go tell someone else...After all I'm a lover not a fighter. lolThank you and may you and your future be blessed.Everyone now go and figure. Always the Conundrum lolSo there we have it folks. A proposal to build a project called ""Amazing Place"". To be built for a gathering place for people in the event that a place is required for the Second Coming of Christ to participate.Again I am not claiming to be the 2nd Coming only that I have had coincidences in my life that make others and myself casually quires at the possibility. So if I am not he, and he does show up we'll have a place for him. As well I am not a false prophet for I make no prophecies to speak of. Only that the Second Coming of Christ, yes Christ, by definition the light of Divine Love that is thread through all of us, be apparent, abundant and necessary for the return of Christ to Earth.So why do I attempt to make Amazing Place a reality? I refer to a popular remark of Dr. Wayne Dyer (well-known spiritualist and author) who says,""Don't die with the music still inside of you""Amazing Place will be my version of a harmonious job site and project for the heart and soul. A composition, bricks, mortar, healthy organic farmland, hotels, concert and congregation halls, recreation, education, healing and culture all done in cooperative concert with nothing but good but to come of it.That being said let us refer to the lyrics of a fitting song that suits my mood, my sense of humor and in some sense the mental space of many of the baby boomers o my generation. He's an Old Hippieby the Bellany BrothersLet's make Amazing Place a reality. If for no other reason than it will give us a fun project to work on for the next many years and keep life interesting. One more song lyric to keep in mind Don't worry be happyby Bobby McferronIf they make this into a movie some day, ""I hope it's a comedy"" lol Now here is The Poem I promised to you at the top of the page. A little reward for completing you task a job well done.- ""The Man Without Money (or) Don't Let The Joke Be On You""The man without money is not the man who is broke.Not like the man who can't laugh at a well-meaning joke.People will eat and people will drink and people will eat, drink, and smoke.And some will even deprive or indulge until they nearly choke.Others might lie, cheat, steal, confront or deliberately provoke.Looking to answer the questions that life will invoke.I think here is truth in these words which are spoke.It is always best to focus one's own personal God-given talents.On that which gives life timing, truth, honor, coordination, just cause, just intent, harmony and balance.So please realize there's nothing that badly broke.If you can still laugh at a well-meaning joke.And should you deal fairly, deal honestly with people, not with bullish tactics and greed.The reputation that comes to precede you will be your true fortune indeed.Believe in these words, belief in them is a must.For it gives you a place and a focus that is just, that others will trust.And you'll find you never feel that you will ever lose face.A you walk on through life in a state of Peace, and a state of Dignity and Grace.So please realize there's nothing anywhere near broke.If you can still laugh at a well-meaning joke.Should you try the thought of these lines if only for the heck of it.You'll find you never have to live in spiritual deficit.And for those who don't believe these lines to be possibly true.I tell you my friend the joke is most certain on them not on me, not on you.The EndSo there we have it folks. Value for the money. Donate whatever you deem the value of the poem. Focused and Fine. ""Five bucks for a fine and feisty frame of feeling"", perhaps? lol Or the value of the dream of a place of peace and amazement and being part of helping in the building of ""Amazing Place"". At attempt to bring peace to the world and resolve conflict. All money received is received with humble appreciation, respect and utmost state of responsibility and determination and dedication to get the project done. It will be built by benevolence and goodwill, and so shall it exist and operate in many regards once built.Why will it be an ""Amazing Place""? It will, because of amazing and abundant response to this project that it will help create jobs, heal people, heal the land, give the contributing people of the world something to take part in. A real cause.Everlasting peace and harmony amongst the people of the world. And a sustainable planet, environment, ecosystem, and political climate. Yes an Amazing Project, Place and Movement.""Amazing Place""Achievable conceivable $2, $5, $10 at a time. Make a game of how many you can bring to the site. Maybe the $40 million will be here by summer next summer or several summers after that. You never know. We'll just make it a pet project of ours to save the planet. No matter how long it takes. Let us all ""rise to the mountain tops to see the Promise Land"" - paraphrase of Dr. Martin Luther King.Maybe you should leave a couple of bucks behind just in case I might be the second coming. I can use it for getting rid of the possible bad issues and bad guys that might come to be or in fact might already be. Refer to Revelations in the bible.The anti Christ has the number 666 associated with him. The address 555 - 5th Ave NY, NY belongs to a building owned by a well known billionaire. ( go out and google to see who it is) On one floor of that building is a company called Lucifer Technologies. They are the developers of micro-chip technologies that are already being put in humans for identification purposes in some companies. Bearing the mark of the Beast of the earth so to speak.There's a large banking computer in Brussels, Belgium that apparently has been accumulating and recording everyone in the world banking system and giving them a number. A triple six digit coding system is at the bottom of it. This computer is speculated to be the Beast of the Earth by some. Intended to take away a person's independence's, rights and freedoms in so many ways. With a few of these apparencies one can only speculate as to the implications or the outcome. One can only wonder.I draw no conclusions other than to be wary of these present day activities and to make my efforts as best I can to help the planet through these unsettled times and to work for the best outcome and resolve for as many as possible. I draw no conclusions on the afore mentioned people or places perhaps. Judge not lest you be judged.So if you'd like to help me out, just in case, your contribution will be appreciated in the utmost.Am I the Second Coming. Who knows for sure. No one ever will probably. All I can say is why did God lead me to notice the coincidences in my life that lead me and others to wonder if I really might be.Go figure.I wish no one any harm, and one purpose of mine is to appeal to the U.S. and N. Korea to de-escalate their confrontation.Ramped up much further and everyone on the planet is a loser in some regard as a result of what could transpire.An old 1960's montra went as follows:Make Love Not War. So since 9/11 it has been ramping up with more and more rivalries, conflicts and animosities in the world than ever before.Remember the rather hopeful calm and progressive confidence there was in the world and a general state of over all well-being before 9/11.All I can ask now is whatever happened to Make Love Not War?People, people, people, where is the love that once was?People, people, people, where is the love.Remember in order to save the world it has to be a group effort. Everyone sharing in the satisfaction of doing something worth while. There may be a very significant need for a world effort for peace and a disarming of minds and battlefields. If you are going to donate I will close with this poem called."" The joke is on You"" or ""The Man Without Money"" as you prefer. If after hearing/reading it  gives you a sense that everyone is ok in the thought and it's a good way to lift the spirits. Then give this project what you think the poem is worth. How about Five Bucks For The Feel Good Factor. lolHelp save the world for $5. The outcome of doing so will be heavenly.This may come as madcap or tongue in cheek reading to you in some regard. I try to keep it lighthearted and humorous but only to be good medicine to the mind. But please be rest assured any donation received and no matter how many millions raised or other assistance provided it will be received with the utmost of respect, humility, care, responsibility and conscientiousness. So thank you ahead of time.Lynn Johnson just a middle of the road regular kind of guy who wants to do something meaningful for the world. In the words of a Paul Simon song ""Don't want to end up a cartoon in a cartoon graveyard""""Peace"" is the theme of this year's Winter Olympics on at this time. Valentine's Day is near so I thought I'd release this to coincide with a time of Love and Peace in the world. As an attempt to bring back even more love and peace to the world and in the years to come. For the love of the planet, the people and all creation.We are all custodians of this planet. Let's take collectively better care of it than we have of late, environmentally, socially, politically. People! People! People!Where is the Peace we all once knew? Especially before 9/11Let us recover and recapture and contribute the missing peace in the building of Amazing PlaceAs for myself I am a low key ,retiring sort who lives a basic, practical life on a small gov't pension, an occasional commissioned sale of green energy with a wind turbine company at www.kelsoenergy.com , some odd jobs and the occasional bit of design and reno carpentry projects. I also buy and sell a bit of used practical and collectible goods I seem to get by and the money that I make helps to look after my 87 year old mother and others that I give help to when I have the change to spare.I guess that's why I have to ask the world to help me in this campaign for mine was spent helping others already. I ask the world for its help so that I can repay the world back by helping reestablish a place in it of peace and love that shall spread through out the world for the day to arrive of everlasting peace.I am not an extravagant or wasteful man and I consider myself quite practical most of the time and that is how I will deal with all funds raised for Amazing Place.So please contribute to this cause, this movement. Ask others to come to this site and do likewise. Make a difference.Nothing ventured, Nothing gained! Let's attempt to make this site experience visitors in a viral, spiral. lol No I'm not crazy and I haven't slipped a gear. It's just a case that the older one gets the more they tend to speak what's on their mind and in their heart than what you think the world expects of you. I guess that's true in my case.Besides i was curious what would come of it if I did do as I have just done , namely releasing this campaign called""Amazing Place"" That and the need to keep life hopeful and interesting for as many as possible.Join the cause and the movement, make a difference, and at least say you tried and gave it an honest attempt Nothing ventured, Nothing gained.If nothing else I hope I have given you food for thought. I hope that they're heavenly thoughts. LOLAnd have a happy and abundant life.I don't ask in you giving a donation that you choose to believe in me as the second coming. I ask you to donate in your belief in God, in love, in peace, good will toward your fellow man and respect for the creatures and all life on the planet.Amazing Place will come to be, not for me, but for everyone who believes in Christ, in the Divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all God's creation.Amazing Place and this planet will be for everyone who comes in Peace and God's love which is Christ. All contributions to this project are to be administrated by a Christian Organization in background. This organization exists as a independent congregation and benevolent charitable organization and is registered as such with gov't and CRA. Conducting activities such as Amazing Place is just one of it's projects.So give and be a part of ""Amazing Place"", a part of something bigger than us all, a ""movement"" refreshed and renewed in the direction of ""Everlasting World Peace"". We've been a state of escalating conflict and war in the world since 911.Let's face it world leadership in many regards has become  ""bunker-lunky"".We need a quantum shift and a focused shift to world peace.Sign on with Amazing Place and make it a notable part of the world movement for Peace and World Community village. Sign on. You have to believe in and stand for something or you will fall for anything. Believe in and stand for Christ and Peace and in Amazing Place to be that vehicle. Believe and act or react upon this moment to make it happen and thanks for your time and donation to help spread the word and make Amazing Place and all it stands for a reality. Thank you.So now that you have read the entire entry do you see any value to it? If so, donate and fund accordingly and spread the word.If you take contempt that I might be the second coming. That the ominous consideration of the book of Revelations might well be right. That might be a just reaction. No one wants those occurrences to come about.I am simply hopefully that some of the spiritual sources I have been in touch with those seers claiming that the real second coming of Christ is not for another 3200 years or so. That there are powers and influences on this planet that are trying to concoct a false state of Revelations of this time of man that will be false Revelations, but destructive and tumultuous to man and the planet nonetheless I'm just trying to diffuse the situation as gently and tactfully as I only remain hopeful that the pendulum of war, chaos and conflict that is upon this world and I'm calling upon the help of others the help of the planet would be nice. If you decide to pitch in and donate and help it would be for a good cause. World peace, safety and sanctuary. May I please imply a sense of urgency in my request for help and spreading the word. ""Every one lives at the hands of the other mans mercy"" Hopefully the pendulum will soon start to swing the other way and there will be a peaceful sustainable outcome for us one and all in the process. Imagine all the peopleliving the life in Peace, you too. You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you join us and the world will live as one.John LennonSo there we all are. Close to the end of the appeal for funding of Amazing Place.Should you fund, look upon it as an act of contributing to a project that's intended to help save the world, if need be. With all the apparencies out there working towards the circumstances of the times of the Revelations it may well need be. I don't want the times of the Revelations and all it's horrors to occur any more than most. However there are forces and influences on this earth and in this universe that are bent on bringing these times upon us. Best to be prepared as best we can to keep the outcome what it is to be. A matter of playing it safe as best we can for a planet of everlasting peace.Food for thought Food for thought.Thank you for reading this entry and thank you in advance for your assistance in helping to bring a final lasting peaceful salvation to this planet.Food for thought food for thoughtPrepare for the worst, work for and hope and strive for the best.Footnote : It would be remiss of me not to mention death of Reverend Billy Graham (an American Evangelist) on Feb. 21, 2018. With this funding page of mine focused somewhat on Christ as the theme one should ask that we remember Rev. Graham in kindness as a man who brought literally millions to the fold and counselled everyone from common man to presidents over many decades of ministry.God Bless and God raise Rev. Billy Graham on highAmenAfter reading all the above, one might ask ""So am I really the second coming or not?"" I guess we'll never know for sure. ""Always the conundrum. Always the conundrum.""While we're all busy trying to figure it out lets build ""Amazing Place""It'll give us something constructive to do with our time. Am I or am I not?

Karen Burson ,"Hamilton, ON",Other,"On the morning of Saturday November 9, 2019 Sean D. was arrested by police officers in front of city hall after being physically assaulted by a member of the racist Yellow Vest group. Sean and his family have been subjected to ongoing threats made by the Yellow Vests and other far right extremists organizing and carrying out acts of violence in plain sight in Hamilton, Ontario. Sean is facing an assault charge from that day's anti-hate rally in front of City Hall, and much like in recent other events, no far-right individuals have been arrested.  Sean was also assaulted at the Mohawk rally in September 29 (in opposition to Maxime Bernier's appearance there) and the police did nothing.Several left-wing activists have been charged in the past months starting with the most recent hate-fuelled attack on Hamilton's annual Pride gathering, while NO charges at all have been laid against members of the far-right. The Hamilton police are continuing their attack on the left -- on those who tirelessly resist hate groups in our city. These charges must be opposed!We are appealing for solidarity and support from concerned citizens, especially those on the left and in the labour movement. The fight against hate in our city requires ALL OF US to come together. This is why we are asking everyone in the community to help with Sean's legal fees.

Vania Niel ,"Hamilton, ON",Other,"Following investigation into a political protest against PPC leader Maxime Bernier’s talk at Mohawk College, HPS began repressive crackdown against left activists.As of today, four antifascists have been arrested and charged in relation to the protest. Vic was re-arrested walking out of class the morning of Wednesday, October 23rd. They are facing charges for one count “theft under $5000” and one count “disguised with intent.” There is no doubt that this is a continuation of the HPS’s repressive behaviour, siding with racist, hyper-nationalist bigots. The most serious charge Vic is facing, and others are too, i.e. “masked with intent” is part of a long-standing HPS tradition to harshly enforce the criminalization of concealed identity as protests. That Vic, alongside others charged, has been doxxed locally and throughout the United States demonstrates the necessity of protecting one’s identity and the importance of combating efforts to criminalize such. We are asking the community to come forward and support Vic in covering their extensive legal costs to combat these charges, and to likewise extend that support to others charged. It is vitally important that we defend our right to protest and do not let HPS limit efforts by deciding for us what tactics are acceptable. It is our duty to prevent the setting of precedent for future harsh and arbitrary repression against our community and new generations of activists. That means unequivocally supporting the Hamilton 4 charged without falling into traps of respectability politics and supporting efforts to fracture and alienate solidarity efforts. Please donate if you have means to spare and share widely!Solidarity forever. ","November 2, 2019",0,"$100,000 goal"
Chad Hudson ,"Granville Ferry, NS",Other,"I have exciting news to share with you: I have been officially nominated as the PPC candidate for West Nova in the 2019 General Election!  My first commitment is to always be straight-up with you so here’s some straight-talk: I can’t do this on my own. This campaign isn’t about me. No successful campaign is ever only about the candidate on the ballot. This campaign is about the movement that our Leader, the Honourable Maxime Bernier, has built from coast to coast to coast. This campaign is about all of us.  I know this campaign is the underdog but no cause worth fighting for was ever easy. We’re up against the establishment parties that have failed Canadians generations. They may be old and stale but they have well-funded, well-staffed and well-honed campaign machines that will outpace us in volunteer power and in fundraising. They’re missing one important thing, however: you. The tide is turning. Across Canada, everyday working people are turning against the career politicians, the Kool-Aid-drinking backroom party hacks and the institutionalized Culture of Corruption that has let them down for too long. The people know the status quo must go. They want new voices, new choices and new ideas. They want a party and a leader that will bring back common sense, good governance and good values. That’s where the PPC and Maxime Bernier comes in. This is where you come in: Please consider donating whatever amount you can to help me compete with the well-funded establishment parties that have controlled our politics for far too long. We have a campaign to build and little time to do so. We have to get started: the voices of the people of our communities have been ignored for too long. My opponents are good people but their party’s representation hasn’t been good enough. Help me end politics as usual. Together we can send a strong message to the political establishment.

Cody Payant ,"Saskatoon, SK",Other,"Dear friends from Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek ,This summer, we continue the most important race of our life. I've not been provided a script for this address. As a matter of fact I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few months.I have spent most of my life politically within the Conservative Party. I recently have seen fit to chart another course. In October, our country will need every ounce of its energy to restore itself. As we know, the costs of government are all assessed upon the people. This means that the farmer is doomed to provide a certain amount of money, out of the sale of his produce, no matter how low the price, to pay their taxes. The manufacturer, the professional man or woman, the clerk, must do the same with their income.The expenses of the government reach everybody. Taxes take from everyone a part of their earnings and force everyone to work for a certain part of their time for the government. The annual spending of our government has exceeded 420 billion dollars, while our nation's federal debt has surpassed 680 billion. These are some of the reasons why I want to cut down public expense. I want the people of Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek to work less for the federal government, and more for themselves. I want them to have the rewards of their own industry. This is the chief meaning of freedom.Until we can reestablish a condition under which the earnings of the people can be kept by the people, we are bound to suffer a very severe and distinct curtailment of our liberty.The interventionist course of both the Liberal and Conservative governments are well documented. From the Conservative governments of Brian Mulroney and Stephen Harper, which added over 400 billion dollars to our nation's federal debt, to the industry crippling socialist economic policies of Pierre Trudeau and his son, these results are not fanciful, they are not imaginary, they are grimly actual and real, reaching in to every household in the land.Currently they take from each family home an average of over 37,000 dollars annually, and taxes must be paid, they are not a voluntary contribution. One of the greatest favors that can be bestowed upon the Canadian people is economy in government. One of the greatest burdens: too much government in the economy.I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by our forefathers in the true north strong and free. And as we are reminded that we don't know how lucky we are to live in Canada, it is perhaps more important to remember the immigrant who reminds us of how lucky they are that they had some place to escape to. If we lose freedom in the west, there is no place left to escape to.And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This too, is a key issue in this election, whether we believe in our capacity as Canadians for self government or whether we abandon Canadian confederation and confess that the unelected councils of the United Nations can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.It is for these reasons that I am unable to in good conscience remain on the sidelines. It is for these reasons that I joined Maxime Bernier and the People's Party of Canada in the first place in August, 2018, and it is for these reasons, that I am now announcing my candidacy as your official PPC candidate for our riding of Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek.Freedom, Fairness, Responsibility and Respect.

That same year I received injections in my spine to help with the chronic pain, but that was only a temporary solution.  So every time I go to Bed Bath and Beyond, I sit in the demo chair with this massager and get a little relief.Since I will soon be a single mom of 2, I feel it would be highly irresponsible for me to spend $300.00 on something like this for myself. So I wrote Obama asking if he’d buy me one since he liked giving my money away to illegals, lazy people, the Deep State, and our enemies, but I never heard back. Then I sent the same letter to Hillary Clinton,  AOC, Maxine Waters, Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rourke, and countless other Democrats/Socialists, but never received the massager or a response. So I’m guessing the color of my skin, the fact that I’m a legal citizen, and the fact that I support President Trump are the reasons they all denied me. So if 300 of my FB Friends could donate $1.00, I could get this massager for my birthday and get some pain relief!!Thank you and may God Bless You and Yours, and May God Bless America!!!WWG1WGA!!

Concerned Ontarians ,"Toronto, ON",Other,"Support this campaign to #stickittodougford and show the Conservative government that we will not stand for seeing our tax dollars wasted on politically-motivated, anti-environmental propaganda.The Ontario Conservative government under Doug Ford has created the following anti-carbon tax sticker, and plan to enforce gas stations in the province to display them under penalty of fines of up to $10,000.Not only is this sticker grossly misleading about the financial costs that the average Ontarian will experience as a result of carbon pricing (70%-80% of households stand to experience financial gain as a result of the carbon rebate), it is a move that seeks to undermine legislation dedicated to taking action against the increasing threat of climate change.To combat this move, we have created two additional stickers that seek to counter the Ford administration's misleading narrative and provide Ontarians with more accurate information about Carbon Pricing in Canada. This campaign is not intended to be an endorsement of the Liberal Party of Canada (every Federal party but the Conservatives supports the introduction of carbon pricing). This is a criticism of the Ford government for enforcing a campaign of misinformation for political gain, and a failure to take action on climate change.The Ford government estimates spending at least $5,000 of tax payers money  printing 25,000 of these stickers. This fundraiser seeks to match that amount, in order to nullify the impact of their campaign. #stickittodougford and show the Conservative government that Ontarians will not stand for this, and are not afraid to combat Ford's misleading and harmful narratives. FundraisingFunds raised will go to the cost of printing environmentally-friendly stickers and distributing them to businesses and any interested individuals.

Quiggin Report` ,"East York, ON",Other,"Operation: Kill Switch asks why a federally registered taxpayer subsidized charitable organization, with alleged links to extremism, still has charitable status?   Why does the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and many of his caucus members have such strong ties to these types of organizations? Military veteran and intelligence expert, Tom Quiggin, has been sharing technical intelligence analysis on this issue and is now targeted in a frivolous multi-million-dollar lawfare lawsuit to try to silence him. Should taxpayer-funded charities be allowed to target our military veterans with your money? -> Help us protect this military veteran who continues to fight to keep our society (and us) safe from growing extremism.-> Help us expose these organizations and their members for their alleged nefarious connections to extremism by supporting our campaign now.Speak up and act while you still can. Your donations and support will help us fight back.BACKGROUNDLast year, Tom Quiggin, an ex-military intelligence and counter-terrorism expert launched a podcast to share his 30 years of experience in intelligence gathering and analysis on the current threats our society is facing.Tom Quiggin is a court qualified expert on terrorism (criminal court and Federal Court) and “intelligence collection and evidence” (Federal Court). Tom has testified on multiple occasions to Senate and the House of Commons Committees as well as a Royal Commission (Air India Inquiry 2007). He has also provided testimony to the Special Senate Committee on Anti-terrorism (2010).  A former Senior Fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he has 30 plus years of practical intelligence experience in a variety of positions including the: - Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Bank of Canada, - Canadian Armed Forces- United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia- Citizenship and Immigration Canada (War Crimes) - International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (The Hague)- Privy Council Office of Canada. - Arms control inspector for the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the Vienna Document. For the past several years Tom Quiggin has been researching the growth of extremism in western nations engaged in a well financed campaign of entryism, fueled by numerous front groups tracing back to the The Muslim Brotherhood Islamist Terrorist network.  Due to the vast amounts of financial support from foreign actors, mainstream media often refuses to report on these and related topics. They fear reprisal or being targeted by lawfare / harassment lawsuits, designed exclusively to cause ongoing financial damages through exorbitant legal fees charged to any defendant. This is the tactic being used now against Tom Quiggin, Raheel Raza of Muslims Facing Tomorrow, and Tahir Gora (co-authors of the book Submission) for filing an official complaint to Canada’s federal police and intelligence agency, The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Canadian Security and Intelligence Agency (CSIS) is also believe to be surveilling similar operations.  In 2015 a federally registered organization was identified as a Muslim Brotherhood front group in Senate Testimony in Canada. Since then, Tom Quiggin has been exposing the facts of its relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas both listed terrorist organizations by a variety of foreign military and  intelligence agencies. This organization has now launched a retaliatory multi-million dollar lawfare harassment lawsuit accusing Tom Quiggin and six other entities of allegedly running a “campaign of defamation”. Although many of the documents sighted in the RCMP complaint are Government of Canada sources, the organization has decided that these are irrelevant and is desperately trying to keep Tom Quiggin’s body of work on this topic hidden from public consumption.   This is an aggressive scare tactic aiming to force us to abandon our platforms, to censor documented facts and obfuscate the responsibility of the actors involved.We will not back down. They have made this a public legal battle where our irrefutable evidence will expose them to public scrutiny. But we desperately need your support. Operation: Kill Switch is how we do this. We need your help to bring the evidence to trial and take this organization down, so if you support this cause, please help us by contributing to the campaign today.OPERATION: KILL SWITCH The federally registered charity, Islamic Relief Canada, is politically connected to the Liberal Party of Canada, influential in terms of policy and directly linked to Islamic Relief Worldwide. (Islamic Relief Worldwide has been listed as a terrorist funding operation by The United Arab Emirates). Much of our evidence has been provided by government documents and or Islamic Relief Canada’s own documentation, but winning the case and pushing back at this  organizations aggressive bullying tactic, cannot be taken lightly. They have considerable financial resources and support from numerous other powerful organizations. In addition, since the Trudeau government was elected, the organisation in question, are now receiving funding directly from the government of Canada to combat “islamophobia”. This will become relevant at a later date. To document and prove the connections, and to follow the money trail, requires a lot of preparation, an organized and strategic response, and financial resources. This is Operation: Kill Switch - A coordinated effort to defend our rights and freedoms, to question and debate the activities of this group and others like it, and deter them from accessing taxpayer money to finance extremist activities abroad.If you believe in this cause as much as we do, please help us and donate to the campaign now.PREPARATION HAS BEGUNThe victims being targeted in this harassment suit have sought legal council to assess the campaign against them.  Based on initial consultations and research, we have started taking action to prepare our response and a statement of defence - a public document highlighting much of our evidence, which has now been filed with the superior court.  Operation Kill Switch is already very much underway:- A team of researchers with expertise in analysis, from various countries and backgrounds, is collecting more and more evidence- Tom Quiggin is working with other specialists in his network, to build on the evidence in the initial statement of defence and ensure the are filed, and on the public record.- Council retained by Tom Quiggin are experienced in the field of defamation and lawfare suits targeting individuals(What is lawfare? Lawfare is a form of war consisting of the use of the legal system against an enemy, such as by damaging or delegitimizing them, tying up their time or winning a public relations victory. The term is a portmanteau of the words law and warfare.  Lawfare is the use or misuse of the law to silence critics or drive them into submission rather than using other means such as civil discourse or discussion. Islamist groups in North America regularly use well-funded lawfare cases to silence or frighten those who expose their extremist beliefs.)- Community groups and leaders have been contacted to address questions about nefarious entities working within the plaintiff organization, allegedly making statements that could be considered hate speech.  For example, Fathima Bahatta executive member of Islamic Relief has been recorded making statements like “the Jews are the enemies of Islam” and long live the antifada [Holly war against Jews.] We have requested an investigation into hate speech comments demanding her resignation.- Operation Kill Switch will also lead a parallel investigation and inquiry asking how an organization with potentially questionable and/or indirect ties to extremism could still be a federally registered charity under Canadian and international law.- Aid concerned advocacy groups working to fight against extremism, hate speech and groups fighting anti-semitism, to highlight such egregious views and demand the immediate resignation of these individuals. WHO IS INVOLVED?The following people are targeted in the proceedings:TOM QUIGGIN Tom Quiggin is a federal and criminal court-qualified terrorism expert whose expertise on the “the reliability of intelligence as evidence” has been recognized by the Federal and Criminal Court of Canada, where his testimony has been entered as evidence on multiple occasions. Quiggin has conducted ground-breaking work to expose facts that are extremely important not only to Canadians but to the international community, as we deal with a global Islamist insurgency which few people are brave enough to address in public forums for fear of targeting by extremists aligned with the islamist cause. This body of evidence is opening avenues for major discussion and debate desperately needed in our society consumed by political correctness, politicking, and the shameful rise of the muzzling of freedom of speech under the banner of Islamophobia. There are opinions and there are facts; Quiggin does not engage in uninformed speculation. There is at least one group, however, attempting to use a tactic called libel chill, using our very own legal system against us, to silence voices like Tom Quiggin purporting that he has used opinion to run a “campaign of defamation”. Quiggin’s expertise has not gone unnoticed and throughout his career, he has been called upon by numerous government entities and specialist organizations to offer his expert advice to their leaders. Today Tom hosts his own podcast to share his intelligence insight with a wider audience, and has a regular spot on National Post Radio and Sirius XM, in his weekly talk with Anthony Fury, host of Canada Talks (channel 167).  Tom is also a frequent guest on syndicated radio programs such as The Roy Green Show with veteran journalist Roy Green, Charles Adler Tonight, Global News Radio with Award Winning Journalist Alex Pierson, Former political leader turned radio journalist Danielle Smith, and numerous alternative media sources, YouTube Channels, podcasts and other forums. RAHEEL RAZARaheel Raza is a member of the Clarion Project Advisory Board and President of the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow. She is an award-winning journalist, author, public speaker, media consultant, anti-racism activist, and interfaith discussion leader. She is the author of, Their Jihad, Not My Jihad: A Muslim Canadian Woman Speaks Out.A constant presence on television, she has appeared as a regular panellist on Jane Hawtin Live, Michael Coren, Ben Mergui Live, Vision, CBC, CTV, City TV, TVO, Faith Journal and Behind the Line on CTS, OMNI as well as on CBC and CFRB radio. In a presentation to Members of Parliament and international diplomats at the House of Commons in Canada, Raza received a standing ovation for her speech called, “Celebrating our Differences.”Raheel has received many awards for her work building bridges of understanding, including the City of Toronto’s Constance Hamilton award for working towards the equitable treatment of women. She also received the Senate of Canada 150 medal in honour of her advocacy. Senator Frum, speaking at the ceremony, cited Raza’s commitment to liberty and equity and thanked her for “relentless advocacy for human rights, particularly the rights of vulnerable girls and women living under Sharia law”.In June 2006, Raheel was invited to meet Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada following which she also had the honour to meet with Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada. Yet, in subsequent years, Canadian leaders have been less honouring of her accomplishments. While politicians are glad to pose for photo ops with more radical voices, Raza said, “a Muslim woman who has been warning about the dangers of radicalization encroaching on the corridors of every institution in this country is kept away like a pariah.”TAHIR GORAGora is a prominent novelist, poet, journalist, editor, translator and publisher with over 30 years of experience in the industry. Recognized as a bold social activist who has initiated many interfaith and pluralistic streams to bring the Muslim community of Canada together to support progressive ideas and actions.He is a strong proponent of freedom of speech and has developed various initiatives to bring about the much-needed changes in the representational and communal aspects of the Canadian Muslim Community. Gora was active in several literary, cultural and political organizations in Pakistan and was a noted critic of religious intolerance in that country. He is a columnist for the Huffington Post, founder of ‘Canadian Thinkers’ Forum’, ‘Progressive Muslims Institute Canada’ and ‘Muslim Committee Against Antisemitism. He is also a recipient of the Queen Diamond Jubilee Medal for his services in Canada.HELP US FIGHT BACKThe suppression of speech and “m103”, the so-called Islamophobia motion, have already gone too far.

Chiefs Council ,"Lax Kw'Alaams, BC",Other,"Sign the Petition against Bill C-49 First Nation Challenges Oil Tanker ban on north coast How American ENGOs are manipulating CDN natural resource development policy First Nations-led project forced to bring investment and employment out-of-countryUsing Indigenous ""puppets and props to kill resource projects""Eco-colonialists undermine First NationsFirst Nations Seek Economic Self-Reliance through Oil Sector  The purpose of this page is to assist over 30 impoverished First Nations with legal and administrative costs needed to fight the Government's unilaterally imposed Oil Tanker Moratorium Act and the Great Bear Rainforest--both of which were established largely through the lobbying of foreign-financed ENGOs and without the consultation and consent of First Nations. With the First Nations-led Eagle Spirit Energy corridor in northern B.C.,  we are explicitly opposed to American ENGOs dictating government policy in our traditional territories in a manner that harms our communities, regions, the energy industry (the most import industry in Canada), and the Canadian economy. The liberal government was supposed to be supporting reconciliation--not perpetuating past failed colonial policies designed subjugate and marginalize indigenous peoples. We are taking such direct action based on the facts where:1.  First Nations have unextinguished Aboriginal rights and title from time immemorial and continuing into the present, or have treaties over the land and ocean of their traditional territories.2.   We have protected the environment as first-stewards of our traditional territories for millennia.3.   We have and will always, put the protection of the environment first, but this must be holistically balanced with social welfare, employment, and business opportunities.4.   We absolutely do not support big American environmental NGO’s (who make their money from opposing natural resource projects) dictating government policy and resource developments within our traditional territories.5.   When such projects are environmentally acceptable and essential to meeting our non-environmental needs such foreign interference serves only to perpetuate the rampant poverty and dysfunction encouraged by previous colonial policies.6. The Great Bear Rainforest was created without any prior consultation or consent as required under Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867 where the Supreme Court of Canada in Tsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia has determined that “The right to control the land conferred by Aboriginal title means that governments and others seeking to use the land must obtain the consent of the Aboriginal title holders…. if the Crown begins a project without consent prior to Aboriginal title being established, it may be required to cancel the project.” 7.   The Great Bear Rainforest is a fiction created largely by foreign environmentalists and we do not support its creation.8.   Given concerns about the environmental impact of Enbridge's Northern Gateway Pipeline, First Nations decided to lead their own first-of-its-kind energy corridor project from Alberta to British Columbia tidewater called Eagle Spirit Energy.9.   After consulting top world experts the most stringent environmental model in the world was developed that would deliver greater protections to the oceans than is currently being allowed for shipping crude oil in every other part of Canada, and for the pipeline on land.10.  We support the First Nations-led Eagle Spirit Energy energy corridor of because it would provide real-world sustainable benefits and own-source revenue and meaningful participation for the poorest communities in Canada through a project whose outcomes cannot be duplicated by government.11.  We are proud to provide a once-in-a-generation solution for a rapid approval process for major energy and other infrastructure through a First Nation sanctioned corridor—a concept that cannot only provide efficiencies and save money for industry, but can minimize the overall impact of such future projects on the environment.12.  We are proud to have a Canadian precedent-setting solution for indigenous participation in a project in the form of the “Chiefs Council” that may be held up as a progressive model to the world of how to achieve win-win results for natural resource development projects through what we thought would be the constructive cooperation of First Nations, Industry, and Government.13.  Regrettably the federal government has introduced, Bill C-48, the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, which would ban crude oil tankers in our traditional territories (despite the fact they are allowing crude oil to be shipped everywhere else in Canada) which is being done without consultation or our consent breaching the Crown’s lawful fiduciary duty to First Nations in a manner that is consistent with United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples, section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and the Government of Canada’s commitment to “…achieving reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples through a renewed, nation-to-nation, government-to-government, and Inuit-Crown relationship based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation, and partnership as the foundation to transformative change.""WHO WILL BENEFIT: Over thirty impoverished elected First Nations, or hereditary governments will benefit from the using the funds for all matters relating to  the organization of a legal campaign to quash the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act (Bill C-48), and to pull our coastal lands out fo the fictional Great Bear Rainforest. These American ENGO-financed government policies create great damage to our communities and our holitistic aspirations for balalnced development. There also needs to be an alternative market for Canadian crude oil export (other than United States which is reportedly costing Canadian companies up to $50 million dollars a day), and stability to the Alberta and British Columbia energy industries.WHEN NEEDED: Support is required immediately as Bill C-48 will likely be passed into law in the near future, and indigenous lands need to be pulled out to the American ENGO-created Great Bear Rainforest.WHAT YOUR SUPPORT MEANS: We are most grateful for your support as we do not have the financial means to sustain such legal and organizational costs where most of our communities have 90% unemployment rates and were described in a recent article in MacLean’s Magazine as the harsh Indigenous reality of poverty symbolized by broken windows and tar paper shacks (that most Canadians don’t see) as having: “…an unemployment rate worse than Sudan and the median income on par with Latvia…infant mortality rate is worse than Russia [where] sewage systems often don’t work…[where] there is no fire department…medical facilities…drug and alcohol addictions are rampant, TB is at epidemic levels, and the rate of HIV infection is higher than Nigeria’s.”It is a sad comment the this action is required to taken against  a federal justice department with an indigenous minister, and with a federal government touting a supposed policy of ""reconciliation, ""  possessing unlimited financial resources .ESE interview with Danielle Smith Global News Radio 770 CHQR Interview with Rob BreakenRidge Bill C-48: House Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities Sickening: First Nations Left Empty Handed as Environmentalist Pressure Kills BC Energy Projects Pipeline has First Nations Backing but May Never Get Built Tanker Moratorium Killing First Nations Enterprise A Sustainable Energy Corridor Community Capitalism: Path to Prosperity Bill C-48: Environmental Hypocrisy Time to Question Outside Influence on Energy Industry First Nations Challenge Oil Tanker Ban ","November 30, 2017","$48,480","$100,000 "

Harleen Aujla ,"Vancouver, BC",Other,"***HELP FUNDRAISE FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS***Here's our backstory:Women’s suffrage (or franchise) is the right of women to vote in political elections; campaigns for this right generally included demand for the right to run for public office. The women’s suffrage movement was a decades-long struggle intended to address fundamental issues of equity and justice and to improve the lives of Canadians. Women in Canada met strong resistance as they struggled for basic human rights, including suffrage. Representative of more than justice in politics, suffrage represented hopes for improvements in education, healthcare and employment as well as an end to violence against women and children. By the mid-19th century, full citizenship was legally limited to men; by the end of the century, laws across the country mandated near-universal, White male citizenship at the federal and provincial level and explicitly excluded female voters. Around that time, many women began to agitate for the vote as well as for social reform. Suffragists — people who advocated for the extension of suffrage — were typically White, middle-class women, many of whom believed that suffrage would increase the influence of their class and result in a better country. Women’s suffrage was also supported by Black abolitionists (such as Mary Ann Shadd), as well as unionists, socialists and temperance activists. The majority of Canadian suffragists relied on peaceful campaigning. Only a handful identified with the militant suffragettes led by Emmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928) and the Women’s Social and Political Union in the United Kingdom.  Achieving the Vote in Federal Elections:During the First World War, pressure mounted on federal politicians in the Conservative — later the Union Government (1917) — of Sir Robert Borden. The government wished both to acknowledge women’s contribution to the war effort and to appeal to future female voters by extending the franchise; it also wanted to firm up support for conscription. The government also feared that voters who were born in countries with which Canada was at war would oppose conscription, especially men born in those countries. In the controversial Military Voters Act and Wartime Elections Act of 1917, the federal vote was extended to nursing sisters (women serving in the Canadian Army Medical Corps) and to close female relatives of military men. At the same time, the Wartime Elections Act disenfranchised thousands of immigrants from enemy countries who had become citizens after 1902 as well as all conscientious objectors (those who refused to go to war because it was against their religious, moral or ethical beliefs). The Act divided Canadian suffragists, many of whom opposed partial enfranchisement and disenfranchisement.  Once conscription was secured, the government began to argue that women had earned the right to vote through their war work. On 24 May 1918, female citizens, not included under racial or Indigenous exclusions, aged 21 and over became eligible to vote in federal elections regardless of whether they had yet attained the provincial franchise. In July 1919, enfranchised women gained the right to stand for the House of Commons, although appointment to the Senate remained out of reach until after the Persons Case of 1929. The Dominion Elections Act of 1920 continued to exclude as voters anyone disenfranchised because of race in the provinces (this meant Japanese, Chinese and South Asians in BC and the Chinese in Saskatchewan) and maintained exclusions of Inuit and most First Nations.  Women in Politics:Once women won the vote, they encountered considerable resistance in entering politics. In 1921, Agnes Macphail became the first woman to win a seat in the House of Commons, representing the United Farmers of Ontario; the next, Martha Black replaced her ailing husband in 1935 as Conservative MP for Yukon; the third, Saskatchewan’s Dorise Nielsen (associated with the CCF and then the Communist Party of Canada), arrived in Ottawa in 1940 but found little support. The first Indigenous female Member of Parliament was the Liberal Ethel Blondin Andrews for Western Arctic, Northwest Territories, in 1988.  This article is for a school project, please do not donate to this.

Cody Payant ,"Saskatoon, SK",Other,"Dear friends from Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek ,This summer, we continue the most important race of our life. I've not been provided a script for this address. As a matter of fact I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few months.I have spent most of my life politically within the Conservative Party. I recently have seen fit to chart another course. In October, our country will need every ounce of its energy to restore itself. As we know, the costs of government are all assessed upon the people. This means that the farmer is doomed to provide a certain amount of money, out of the sale of his produce, no matter how low the price, to pay their taxes. The manufacturer, the professional man or woman, the clerk, must do the same with their income.The expenses of the government reach everybody. Taxes take from everyone a part of their earnings and force everyone to work for a certain part of their time for the government. The annual spending of our government has exceeded 420 billion dollars, while our nation's federal debt has surpassed 680 billion. These are some of the reasons why I want to cut down public expense. I want the people of Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek to work less for the federal government, and more for themselves. I want them to have the rewards of their own industry. This is the chief meaning of freedom.Until we can reestablish a condition under which the earnings of the people can be kept by the people, we are bound to suffer a very severe and distinct curtailment of our liberty.The interventionist course of both the Liberal and Conservative governments are well documented. From the Conservative governments of Brian Mulroney and Stephen Harper, which added over 400 billion dollars to our nation's federal debt, to the industry crippling socialist economic policies of Pierre Trudeau and his son, these results are not fanciful, they are not imaginary, they are grimly actual and real, reaching in to every household in the land.Currently they take from each family home an average of over 37,000 dollars annually, and taxes must be paid, they are not a voluntary contribution. One of the greatest favors that can be bestowed upon the Canadian people is economy in government. One of the greatest burdens: too much government in the economy.I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by our forefathers in the true north strong and free. And as we are reminded that we don't know how lucky we are to live in Canada, it is perhaps more important to remember the immigrant who reminds us of how lucky they are that they had some place to escape to. If we lose freedom in the west, there is no place left to escape to.And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This too, is a key issue in this election, whether we believe in our capacity as Canadians for self government or whether we abandon Canadian confederation and confess that the unelected councils of the United Nations can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.It is for these reasons that I am unable to in good conscience remain on the sidelines. It is for these reasons that I joined Maxime Bernier and the People's Party of Canada in the first place in August, 2018, and it is for these reasons, that I am now announcing my candidacy as your official PPC candidate for our riding of Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek.Freedom, Fairness, Responsibility and Respect. These are the words we have heard often over the past ten months, and these are the words we will continue to hear as we work for Canadians to restore peace, order and good governance to the House of Commons. Send me to Ottawa my friends and I promise you, you will not be disappointed.Thank you and God bless.","July 18, 2019",0,"$5,000 goal"

I guess that means I want to take away your guns. Spooky scary.Without the electoral college, elected officials would win by popular vote, not electoral. I want to abolish it.I believe in protecting refugees.I believe in cutting the military budget in half to fund infrastructure. I believe in taxing the rich. In fact, I believe in a 70% marginal tax rate.I believe in raising the minimum wage.I believe in universal healthcare.There's much more scary things you have expressed several times you want out. The reason why you would want me out because of it is because if we are unable to get out before my child starts school, I'm going to begin running for office and working my way up until I'm a senator or house representative.

Erika Nicole Triggs ,,"Medical, Illness & Healing","I'm raising money to benefit ENDOMETRIOSIS ASSOCIATION (CANADA), any donation will help make an impact. The goal is $20,000 by December 26th!We need more research! (all non-personal information has been taken directly from the World Endometriosis Research Foundation website: http://endometriosisfoundation.org/about/endometriosis/  and was not written by me)Endometriosis affects an estimated 176 million women worldwide during their most reproductive and productive years.Many of these women struggle daily with the symptoms of endometriosis:• Pain at menstruation, ovulation, intercourse, bowel movements, urination• Sub-fertility• Fatigue, bloating, nausea, heavy bleeding• Possibly a susceptibility to develop other diseases, including certain cancersTreatments include:• Painkillers• Birth control pills• Hormonal suppression• Surgical removal and, for some, hysterectomy.For most women, side effects are associated with all of these treatments, and none of them cure the disease.Why do we never hear of endometriosis?Even in the most “liberal” of countries, female health issues, in particular those associated with menstruation, painful intercourse and infertility, are topics that are not readily discussed in society. They are still taboo in the 21st century.Yet, all of these are associated with endometriosis, and women who are affected have to deal with these challenges on a daily basis. Unfortunately many mistakenly believe that “pain is part of being a woman” – even though pain is the body’s way of saying: something is not right.This lack of awareness leads to an average diagnostic delay of up to seven years depending on health care settings.Endometriosis may be progressive, and recent research has indicated that a delayed diagnosis can be associated with more severe disease.This is why it is so important that we invest in research to find the cause and prevention.My personal experience with endometriosis:Ive had abdominal pain since i was about 10-11 years old (i'm 25 now). My parents used to take me to the doctor and the hospital for severe abdominal cramping, where ultrasounds and blood tests yielded no results so we were simply sent home. As i got older, this pain started to get worse. It wasn't only associated with my period, it could happen at any time of the month, but as i grew up i did start to track things and notice a definite correlation between the most severe pain ""that time of the month"". I went on birth control pills when i was 16, hoping that it would help with the pain i felt, as it was getting so bad that i would be physically ill (nausea, vomiting, dizziness). Before i started college a doctor incorrectly diagnosed me with IBS because of the bloating and abdominal pain, even though i was adamant that the discomfort did not appear to be brought on by food/drink. During college my immune system took a hit and it seems like i never fully recovered. I have much worse immunity than i previously did, even though i now try to make a conscious effort to eat better and exercise. I missed classes because i became very ill, and eventually dropped out of college in 2014 after 1 and 1/2 years. I spent the rest of 2014 trying to feel better based on methods used to help IBS, but nothing seemed to work. I decided to return to school in 2015, this time university, and continued to follow IBS diet plans. However, the pain only got worse. Half way through my first year at Wilfrid Laurier University i began to notice intense pain and rectal bleeding that would occur a few days before my period - the pain continued throughout it. In March of 2016 i went into the GRH ER after being up for hours with pain so intense i couldn't stand up straight. I was admitted to the hospital that day because the doctors believed i needed exploratory surgery, thinking i had a case of chronic appendicitis, and the next morning i went for surgery. The surgeon removed my appendix, and told me that he found endometriosis growing on it and in my abdominal cavity. He never elaborated any more than that, even though i asked questions, and told me to see a gynaecologist. He never mentioned that endometriosis could have caused the pain id been feeling, never specified where it was growing (aside from on my appendix), and never explained what it was. I had heard about it before but only as one of the things that can cause female infertility. It took me a year to be referred to and get an appointment with a gynaecologist, who didn't give me any viable treatment options (other than to continuously take birth control so i would skip my period more often) because i told her i wanted to have children. She actually encouraged me to get pregnant (i was then 21, a student, and single) and said that having surgery to remove the endo. could make the condition worse because of scar tissue, and i could end up with fertility issues if i dint already have them (which she said i wouldn't know until i tried to conceive). She also told me that if i wanted diagnostic surgery to see exactly where the endo. was growing and how severe it was, that she would remove whatever she could while she was 'in there' despite just telling me about scar tissue linked to infertility. I left that office without any new solutions. To manage the pain, nausea, and dizziness i felt on an almost daily basis, i started using a hot water bottle, taking over-the-counter pain pills that didn't work, getting IV's of pain and nausea medication at the hospital, and doing most of my course work for university from my bed. There were, and still are, days where my clothes don't fit, i look pregnant, i cant wear pants or anything with a tight waist because of the pain and bloating, i feel so nauseous in the morning that i cant get out of bed or eat without puking, the pain is so bad that i cant stand up straight, walking hurts - the list goes on. In 2018 i was hospitalized for weeks because i contracted the infection C.diff due to doctors over-prescribing me antibiotics for what they assumed were gastro and bladder infections (even when my urine and blood tests came back normal). Now, here i am in 2019. I made it through 4 years of university by being honest with the school's accessible learning centre, spending what has to be hundreds of dollars on doctors notes to prove to professors and the accessible learning centre that my condition was chronic and very real, having multiple trips to the hospital for pain management, and doing A LOT of work from my bed (including while i was in the hospital in 2018). It's July 2019 and i JUST got an appointment with a new gynaecologist at a Women's Clinic in Hamilton, Ontario. He's taken me seriously, he's looked at my medical records, and in September i'm finally getting the diagnostic surgery i asked for in 2016 (to see how bad and specifically where the endometriosis is growing). Theres a lot of unsavoury (by that i mean TMI) details , many other experiences with doctors, and a LOT of personal feelings i've left out.There is NOT enough options for people who are affected by endometriosis. There hasn't been enough research and communication about the cause of endometriosis and related disorders. We need to know whats causing it, have realistic treatment options that actually work, and learn how to prevent it. We also need MUCH more advocacy for this disease. It has been brushed aside as 'period pain' and 'cramping' for too long. I cant count the amount of people iv'e spoken to who don't know what endometriosis is (many of them women). It becoming more recognizable, but even people who've heard the name, don't know what it is or what it does. People who don't have it don't understand what it's like to have it and the effects the disease has on you both physically and mentally. Just because you always look sick on the inside, doesn't mean you're not fighting something. And there is no cure. If you would like more information about endometriosis, it is very easily googled. You can find advocates on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. You can hear personal testimonies from people on YouTube. You can read the blogs of people suffering from this disease. It's real, it can be severe, and frankly it can make you feel like your life is ruined.I am asking people to donate to the Endometriosis Association. Endometriosis is just as worthy of donations, no matter how small, as any other chronic illness or disease. It effects MILLIONS of women worldwide and can have a detrimental impact on physical health, mental health, financial earning capability, and personal relationships.","July 20, 2019",0,"$20,000 goal"
Vaden Earle ,"Kingsville, ON",Accidents & Emergencies,"This has been a long awaited step and it is finally here. On April 22, Immigration Canada formally issued Widlene a letter of refusal for her Visa application, thus denying her entry into Canada. The answer came only after several Liberal MPs confronted Ahmed Hussen about his inhumane treatment of this file, and of Widlene's situation specifically. Some may remember when I confronted Hussen at one of his events on February 24, 2018. With the CityNews cameras rolling, Hussen stated clearly that emergency files like this one should receive an answer within 20-30 days and that any longer ""would be unreasonable."" Apparently, Minister Hussen confused 30 days with 16 months, and here we are. The refusal letter itself ought to be admitted into some comedy archive somewhere or, at least, featured on a couple of the Late Night TV shows. Remember, this letter is a formal refusal from Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada to inform a client that they are being denied entry to the country on a Government of Canada letterhead. This is meant to be a pretty official document.In the 13 page document, our legal team has found 22 errors in law and/or in fact.Over the next little while, I will be posting excerpts from this ridiculous piece of fiction, but for now, we have a job to do. We have filed an official appeal in Federal Court. This next bit is likely to be one of the most important paragraphs that you will ever read on this Campaign:There are literally tens of thousands of children that either are stuck or have been stuck in IRCC adoption limbo.  This department of the Canadian government has become so bias against adoptive families that it has become common practice to arbitrarily deny applications just to discourage families from pursuing adoptions. ""The Minister [Ahmed Hussen] doesn't like the optics of white families rescuing black children.""- Ali Salam (former chief of staff to Ahmed Hussen)According to several lawyers who have reviewed this case, a win for Widlene has an extremely high potential to become precedent setting.  One immigration lawyer said that ""this is the first case in decades that has the potential to fix a broken system."" We knew that Widlene Earle would become the voice to so many other children but we didn't know that this had the potential to change adoption law.Here is the bottom line...We are willing to take on the Hussen, his staff and all of the other corrupt people that are abusing their power, and thus abusing children who are just seeking as better life. There is no way that we can fund this alone. This campaign has killed us financially and this appeal is another giant expense that we have to shoulder. We often talk about influencing change or being a part of the solution. We get on social media and argue about politics or complain about a broken system. This is an opportunity to participate in changing something substantial.We are not guaranteed a win. We are not guaranteed that this will become law. We are guaranteed that they want us to withdraw our claim and are doing everything to achieve this. We are also guaranteed that, if we don't try, we cannot fix the problem.In the middle of it all, there is a sweet 13 year old girl that just wants to live a normal life with her whole family in safety where she can enjoy basic human rights. We can make that happen.Please join us if you are able.","June 22, 2019","$16,479","$22,500 "
Mike Sawyer ,"Smithers, BC",Other,"My name is Mike Sawyer, and I live in Smithers, BC. I'm very concerned about the environmental, climate and social impacts of LNG development in British Columbia.Two years ago, I challenged the assessment of the natural gas pipeline that would feed the proposed Pacific Northwest (Petronas) LNG facility on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert. With the help of West Coast Environmental Law, I argued that the proposed Prince Rupert LNG pipeline should have been assessed and permitted under federal jurisdiction. The basis for my challenge was the 1998 Supreme Court of Canada “Westcoast” decision that found pipelines which appeared to fall under provincial jurisdiction actually would fall under federal jurisdiction if they were functionally integrated into an existing federal pipeline. My legal challenge was successful, but before the Prince Rupert LNG pipeline could undergo federal regulatory assessments, the proponent abandoned that project.Thank you to all of you who supported me through that legal challenge, where we established an important legal precedent that will help us now and in the future.In early October 2018, LNG Canada (made up of Shell, Malaysia’s Petronas, PetroChina, Korea Gas Corp and Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp) announced its Final Investment Decision and that it will begin construction of a $40 billion LNG export facility in Kitimat, the largest private construction project in Canadian history. Ever!As part of that massive project, TransCanada announced it will begin construction the Coastal Gaslink LNG pipeline  (Coastal GasLink) from the fracking fields of northeast BC to feed LNG Canada’s Kitimat facility. Coastal Gaslink was assessed through the BC environmental assessment process and approved by the BC Oil and Gas Commission and currently has all provincial approval needed to start construction.But I believe Coastal GasLink should have been assessed and permitted under federal jurisdiction and that the current provincial authorizations are not valid.In July 2018, I filed an application with the National Energy Board challenging the jurisdiction of the Government of BC to approve Coastal GasLink.  This challenge is again based on the 1998 Supreme Court of Canada Westcoast decision and 2017 decision of the Federal Court of Appeal from my successful legal challenge last year.I have taken on this challenge for three reasons:First, we are told we live in a democracy based on good government and the rule of law and it is my view that when the governments break the law, as I believe they have done in this case, it is citizen’s obligation to make sure the governments obey the law.  And this is what I am doing.Second, the assessment and permitting of Coastal GasLink under provincial jurisdiction is fatally flawed in that the BC Environmental Assessment Act and process is wholly inadequate for assessing a project of this magnitude. For example there were no public hearings, no opportunity to cross examine and test TransCanada’s or LNG Canada’s evidence, and no consideration of upstream or downstream cumulative effects, no honest consideration of  the life-cycle carbon emissions, and finally, the decision to approve Coastal GasLink was made behind closed doors. On top of all of this, the Liberal Government of the day, and apparently now the current NDP Government, have so much political capital invested in ensuring LNG goes ahead that I believe they are incapable of making fair and unbiased decisions about LNG that are in the public interest.  Finally, if I am successful in my challenge, and I believe I have a great case, the permits for Coastal GasLink will be cancelled and TransCanada will need to reapply to the national Energy Board for new authorizations, including a full and complete environmental assessment under the federal environmental assessment legislation. It is only through that process, imperfect as it is, that we will see a proper consideration of true impacts of the largest construction project in Canadian history.For example, supporters of the LNG Canada and Coastal GasLink project argue, as Prime Minister Trudeau has, that the LNG Canada project is good for the environment because the use of natural gas from BC will allow China to reduce its carbon emissions by 50 percent. That is a deliberate lie.Yes, it’s true that natural gas is a clean burning fuel at the burner tip, cleaner than coal. But if we do full life-cycle accounting of all carbon emission, from exploration, drilling, producing, processing, transporting, liquefying in Kitimat, marine transportation to China and then burning the natural gas in China, total GHG emission will be 2 percent to 27 percent higher, not lower, than the life-cycle carbon emissions from coal.The assessment of LNG Canada and Coastal GasLink also did not consider the devastating impacts in NE BC associated with the exploitation of the natural gas resources. It did not consider the direct impacts on endangered species, specifically caribou, or surface water, fish, vegetation, local and regional air pollution, fracking, and impacts on traditional land use of indigenous communities.Without a full consideration of all of the impacts and benefits of this massive project, the largest in Canadian history, how can we truly know that it’s in the public interest, both now and in the future?Please support this critically important legal challenge to make sure industry and government play by the rules, and give a proper second chance to determine whether the environmental, climate and social impacts of this massive fossil fuel export development scheme are in the Public Interest.But I need your  help.  TransCanada and the NEB have lots of money and expensive lawyers. To fund my appeal, I need to raise $50,000 by April 30, 2019. If my appeal is successful, it will mean that this and future pipeline projects will have environmental and social impacts properly assessed and government regulators will be required to follow the law.Thank you for your support!

Ben Done ,"Sudbury, ON",Education & Learning,"I met Gracia a short time ago when he was given shelter by my residence at Huntington University. He was very friendly to me, polite, and happy to be moving into our building. What I found out later is that Gracia hadn't had a roof over his head since April of 2016. Before moving to Canada in 2007, 28-year-old Gracia lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Africa. Upon moving here, he had a place to stay, but unfortunately it fell though. But that didn't stop Gracia, and he has continued to study Liberal Science at Laurentian University, despite having no place to call home in this cold northern city. From the moment I met Gracia, I could tell that he was an outstanding young man who does not consider himself a victim of his circumstances. He believes that each hardship, even something like a common cold, is a challenge for him to overcome - something to remind him that he has the strength to succeed in this world. In just two days of living in Huntington, he demonstrated his community-minded kindness by cleaning all of the dirty dishes in our community kitchen, which is shared by almost forty students. This is a man that no matter how little he has, is always looking to help others in whatever way he can.With their own situations to deal with, Gracia has no family to turn to here in Sudbury. Thanks to the LAMPS (Laurentian Association of Mature and Part-time Students), he has found his way into my residence and into the arms of a new community that wants to make him part of our family. Asking for little, Gracia has been incredibly grateful for the help he has received so far.  In the spirit of the holidays, I ask that we come together to help this young man get on his feet, because I know that once he does, he will pay it back to the world tenfold. The money raised  will be used to make sure that Gracia has shelter, food, clothes, school supplies, and help him finish his degree so that he can guarantee a better future for himself.Once the funds have been delivered into my account I will withdraw the amount necessary to pay for Gracia's residence for the remainder of the year. I will set up a meeting with the Huntington Residence Accounting office to do that. Gracia and I will work together to decide how much of the remaining funds will go towards his tuition and how much he will need for food and other essentials. Let's make this a Christmas that Gracia will never forget! ￼","December 6, 2017","5,775 $","15,000 $ "

Annastasia Clarke ,"Salt Lake City, UT",Other,"To Whom It May Concern:Please help me to help my friend, who desperately needs your generosity and support.My name is Thys de Beer.I am a 38 year old heterosexual male, writing this to anyone willing to help a dear trans-gendered friend of mine whom I would prefer to call ‘Sebastian’ for the purpose of protecting his identity.This is a person who desperately needs help above my own capabilities to provide for now although I am committed towards helping him every step of the way.Please note, that if I spend time introducing myself to you, instead of introducing my friend, it is to establish my credibility, as I will be playing a strong part in his future as our lives are very much intertwined.1. Background:‘Sebastian’ and I met during high school where we became immediate friends in mutual recognition ofour outcast status.Our ‘outcast’ status was not because of maliciousness, but rather a mutual inability to conform to theconservative society of our town, where we were teens in post-apartheid South Africa.The authority structures we were subservient to were slow to relinquish the ideas now readily shunned,and we were frequently subjected to physical violence, which was openly endorsed by those supposedto protect us from such harm.There was a mutual recognition between us, although the recognition was not based on shared ideas. It quickly became apparent that we had vastly different philosophical ideas, as well as opposing religiousoutlooks and were the products of vastly different backgrounds.However, in a world where one is frequently attacked for having a different outlook, our friendship was established on respect regarding our differences, and genuine interest in our different motivations.I discovered in him a person of staggering intellect, and genuine sensitivity behind the abrasive exterior which I soon recognized as a desperate defense mechanism.I also soon discovered why the defensive exterior was needed.I came from a liberal household wherein the idea was actively promoted that we explore different ideas to achieve discovery of our own identity. Towards this we were encouraged to challenge ideas, although it came with stern lessons regarding responsibility and consequences.By contrast, ‘Sebastian’s’ household presented an extremely narrow ‘identity’ which had to be adhered to. And any deviation resulted in severe punishment, which reinforced the message that absolutely nodeviation from the prescribed model would be tolerated.The severity of destructive mindset was made extremely clear in 1998 when the overbearing conditions of his household drove him to his first attempted suicide.I will add, that this was not an overly dramatic ‘cry for help’, but a legitimate and desperate attempt to escape the inescapable situation of his reality. His suicide was interrupted by sheer chance. But his parents’ reaction is what I need to share, because it perfectly explains the situation which over the years contributed towards the one I now need your help with.At the moment of his suicide attempt, his letter clearly explained the profound desperation he felt at being unable to be himself, and being punished for his inability to assume the prescribed identity he hadto conform to.During that event, the main catalyst was his inability to express himself religiously, which is an intimate part of our identity.Personally, he felt completely alienated from Christianity, which as his parents practiced it, became the constant justification for the abuse he was subjected to.Their response continues to stun me to this day.Knowing his reasoning, they responded to summon the church minister to come and preach to him. My objection is not religious, but rather, being perfectly aware that their pressure drove their son tosuicide, they decided the best course of action was to persist and increase the pressure.The minister was a dear friend of mine, and I was a member of his church, and I will say he had the tact not to push the topic despite the parents’ insistence. But the event illustrates their approach.2. Going forward.My parents immigrated shortly thereafter, and I was forced to adjust to independence fairly quickly.My career allowed me to leave our town shortly thereafter, and my friend was soon to follow. In the two decades leading up to the present, we both enjoyed successful career.There was admittedly occasional set-backs, during periods of change, as in our separate capacity we moved or weathered change, but overall we could both celebrate our achievements.During the times of tribulation, it was easy to support each other where needed, and as such we have experience of living together whilst one is going through a challenging moment, and memories of arewarding friendship which made difficult times inconsequential.Three years ago my personal life ran into complications.Our country was ravaged by the worst drought in history which forced me to close my business at a massive loss. (I was a nursery-man).The death of a mentor/father figure caused a profound shift in my priorities. In response I attempted to immigrate to my mother in Canada to re-unite with her. It was unsuccessful, and again resulted in a further devastating loss.Three years have been fantastic for me however in terms of growth.The frustration of the three years have long since turned into lessons which I appreciate. After several moves, I am perfectly content in a new city and dedicated to my new career as an estate agent.My life is also extremely modest and I am perfectly content in the monastic living environments from where I am re-building my career.During that challenging time I had opportunity to see ‘Sebastian’, and at the time his life seemed great. His career was going great, and after many stable years in a serious relationship, his girlfriend and hebecame engaged. He was a good provider for her and her two daughters.Contact thereafter was rare. In my own way I discovered that a lot of the people who made up my life before my failure could no longer relate to me in the vastly different context my life had changed into,and from my personal perspective I had very little contact with my loved ones to spare them from the collateral that accompanied my life in pursuit of my dream to reunite with my mother.I thus assumed that in the absence of contact, no news was good news.In this I was wrong.3. The changes in his reality.Three weeks ago I received a message that his own life had gone through dramatic changes with disastrous results.We had a very long and open phone conversation regarding the events which led to his situation. In the accepting space of his relationship he discovered that he is trans-gendered.Whilst it took him a while, he was conscious of the repercussions which would happen once he ‘came out’, and I admire him for doing so in any way.The results was the obvious cancellation of his engagement. His fiance, to her credit, was extremely supportive, but there are obvious practicalities which does not allow for their relationship to continue.From his side he acted honorable in ensuring that his departure from their lives would not put financial strain on them.The bulk of his friends were not supportive, and he found himself effectively deserted.The company he worked for was not impressed at  all and subsequently terminated his employment.Whilst our country has strong laws against discrimination, they can use different motivations to terminate employment, which they did.The conclusion was that he quickly arrived in a position where he was unable to perform his financial duties with obvious disastrous results, and the desperation of his situation resulted in another suicideattempt.When we spoke, he was days away from eviction, and facing destitution. His only available option is to move back to his parents, and the town we came from. Which is the worst possible environment for him.True to their form, his parents have already made it clear that the arrangement comes with the condition that he will be expected to “be normal”. Even now, ‘the opinion of the community’ is by far a bigger concern for them than the well-being of their child.In that environment abuse is guaranteed to continue.4. The solution, and practical implications:Going back to our home town and an environment where he is forbidden from being himself is not an option, and not one which he is going to survive.My solution is that he joins me in the city where he has the benefit of anonymity, the opportunity to explore his transition without any opposition, along with my dedicated support.To enable this, my intention is to rent an extremely modest apartment, in a modest part of the city, where we can move in together.This is a long term arrangement where I can support him in full, and assist him to re-build his life.Both of us are extremely aware that it is going to be very complicated to find employment as a Trans-Gendered person who is going through the transition phase, and I want to ensure that he has the dignityand measure of financial freedom that does not put him in a position where he feels dependent on me. We have several opportunities to attempt so that he may start generating an income, but I want to have the security that this does not end in another disaster. The reality is that I am not yet at the stage where I can do this by myself. I am still an intern, and whilstmy career is guaranteed to be a success, I am several months away from receiving my first pay out.Once that is secure, I will take over the financial responsibility and at the end of my document I will explain where any and all surplus funds will be directed.5. What the finance will be used towards (and where it will not be used): I need to secure a deposit on the apartment I intend to rent for us, and want to know that I can maintain the running costs for the interim months until my own pay-out happens. I want to get the extreme basic furniture which we would need to function. I am not materialistic at all, and have long since given my own furniture to charity (more on that at the end) and I maintain a minimalist lifestyle where up to now, the modest room where I live isfurnished. I would love the opportunity to be able to supply him with a small and basic, second-hand vehicle. Our country does not have a significant public transport system, and I see great value for him to have the freedom of mobility, but also so that he is empowered towards his jobhunting. My own responsibilities comes with unpredictable demands on my time. I drive constantly, and do not want him to miss a rare opportunity because I am not available.This also comes with a responsibility towards his insurance. I need to ensure that he will have uninterrupted access to the hormones he requires. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity for him to have access to a therapist to assist him with his transition state and environment. If financially possible, I strongly believe that I must get professional counselling as well to assist him. Despite my best intentions I am fallible, and this is uncharted waters for me.What we will not use the funding towards is: Cosmetic work on him. For now, we are focused on the absolute essentials and agree that cosmetic work will be his responsibility once he can afford it. The debt he incurred during the collapse of his previous environment. We agree that it is his responsibility, and not to be addressed with charity funds.6. Important considerations and relevant observations: Neither of us harbor expectations that this is going to be fun and games. We are realistic regarding the challenges that face us, and committed towards overcoming them. His suicide attempts are not the product of depression. I can imagine the strain of decades of constant confirmation that “you are not allowed to be you”. I support his decision to actively look for a career that accepts him as a Trans-Gendered person. I know it makes it exceedingly more difficult, but after decades of being denied the opportunity to be himself, I support the idea to find an environment where he is allowed to be himself. I am not entering this with the state of mind as a Martyr. This is an important distinction for me. Whilst I see the opportunity to produce positive results, I am reluctant to go viral with this in my own country. Everyone who knows me will be quick to make the connection as to who I amreferring to and I want to preserve his control to declare or protect this on his terms.  I am aware that my continuous use of the male pronoun may offend some of you. For the purpose of this letter I decided to maintain authenticity, and will adjust as opportunity allows.My friend is thankfully extremely understanding and lenient to allow me this adjustment.7. Surplus funds:In 2007 I became actively dedicated towards charitable causes. During the five years following my introduction my energy was focused on assisting abused women and girls to escape their environments,and deal with the logistics involved. This service included assistance towards the establishment and upkeep of safe-houses, and assisting those affected towards re-building their lives.Over the years my attention shifted towards helping those affected by wild fires. This includes support towards the fire fighters to keep them supplied as best we can. And active labor in handling the receiving and distribution of donations and aid.I have established food gardens. Worked with orphanages. And for short period of time assisted a charity dedicated to babies burned in fires, although I will openly admit that I found that to be tooemotionally traumatic.After the chemical weapon attacks in Syria I also applied to be allowed to go assist, as was the case with the fires in Athens when once more I applied to be allowed to go assist.All of this can be verified, and I feel it is of value to illustrate that my life is not motivated by personal gain.Before I found out about my friend’s situation, I was actively planning to purchase a braille printer with the intention to supply all major restaurants in the two cities in my vicinity with braille menu’s, and toidentify more locations where braille information can assist the blind.My intention is to divert all surplus funds towards that goal, or reputable charity organizations whose integrity I can vouch for and whose work I admire.8. Conclusion and contact arrangement:My personal e-mail is thysdebeer12@gmail.com if anyone feels the need to contact me directly. I am more than willing to engage in video call as well and assist with any other verification required.I have set up a completely separate account dedicated to this goal and would be willing to supply statements and full financial reports if required.Thank you for your time and consideration.My Best Regards,Thys de Beer","March 18, 2019",$50,"$20,000 "
Lynn Johnson ,"Oxbow, SK","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","""A PLACE FOR ALL"" and an  ""AMAZING PLACE"" it will be!!!This funding site is being updated as of today Wednesday, February 27, 2019 because I wish to broaden the scope of my call for funding. There is a Federal Election this fall in Canada. Due to this if I receive enough in donations to afford to, it is my every intention to run for member of parliament as an independent candidate.I have supported and voted for various parties provincially and federally in the past . All parties have their strong points, all parties have their frailties and short comings.I agree with Trudeau and the Liberals that a strong middle class is key to a strong stable economy, and I also agree that the Harper Conservatives were treacherous and divisive in their negative approach to politics and so I tend not to follow their example much. Rt. Hon. Joe Clark never became a Conservative but chose to remain a Progressive Conservative which I find to be a far more palatable political approach for conservative politics. Maxime Bernier has recently started a Conservative off shoot party called the People's Party which is a resurrection of the Progressive Conservative party. I may decide to align part of my independent platform with that of the People's Party over time as we find out more about them. I do contend that the presence of a progressive conservative party is a good thing to have in Canadian politics again. Welcome back Maxine Bernier et al.I also feel the Green Party has some relevant positions on environmental and social issues which bear consideration when running a country and deciding what's best. Their leader, Elizabeth May sets a very good example of a deliberate attempt in the over all picture of Canadian politics of a cooperative and constructive interaction with other parties and their affairs. She sets a good example of how politicians should attempt to interact on a day to day interparty basis.The NDP under Jack Layton were a party that championed the little guy, and the thought of inclusiveness and acceptance of others. For the most part that is a fairly good position to maintain. The NDP also has it's concerns with social programs and structure.Again they have their good points and their bad but definitely have issues, ideas and perspectives to be considered when running this country.You may want to know what my thoughts are on the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana last Oct. 17, 2018. Let's just say, ""If you can't keep off the grass, just mow the lawn when necessary."" LOLMedical marijuana has it's many merits and benefits and as far as what people choose to do is really their own business as long as there's no harm to others.So I want to run for Parliament this fall, so please help fund my campaign. I ran for Parliament in 1984 when I was 28 years old as a Rt. Hon. John Turner Liberal. He wasn't crazy about free trade and risking becoming an economic trading colony and economic puppet of the USA and neither was I.I was not successful in my efforts and withdrew my candidacy prior to the nomination meeting. This was so I wouldn't split the vote and risk having a more qualified candidate miss out and lose the nomination.It is over 30 years later and I feel qualified for this job now.So please read my entry in it's entirety, donate to my cause and vote for me this fall as an Independent candidate for Parliament. As a independent I can speak my mind, say the things that should be said, and not be muzzled to tow some misguided party line in some cases.So enjoy the rest of my entry. Donate to my campaign and cause, get in touch to volunteer to be part of the campaign team if you like and see you on the campaign trail. If I raise adequate enough funds to finance the campaign in time.Why should you donate? With the economy in our area as slow as it is as a result of the low price of oil if I am elected I'd have a job again and I would have a definite appreciation of it and would serve this constancy well and from a grassroots approach.I intend to represent the constituency of Qu’Appelle-Moose Mountain, with the position of taking what's best from all parties and what makes the most pragmatic sense, as opposed to being stuck with some old outdated party mantra or belief. I will represent the voices and concerns and best interests of my constituency first as apposed to towing some external party line interest. This I can do as an independent M.P.As far as political experience I have some to call on from my past and I've been governor of my own independent state of mind all my life. LolJoin the effort, join the campaign, volunteer if you like. The main priority is that we do some good as a result, enjoy the task at hand and of course have some constructive fun.So read the rest of my entry and find out who you might want to vote for this fall in the Federal election. Enjoy!Pre-Amble to the Main Entry called ""Amazing Place""The content in the main entry entitled ""Amazing Place"" may be in the eyes of many readers something that sounds far-fetched perhaps, maybe even something to read in a tongue-in-cheek frame of mind.""Amazing Place"" is about a regional real estate, spiritual, resort, entertainment, educational development concept that had been conceptualized close to 40 years ago. This concept had been put together by myself, Lynn Johnson, and a few key blue-chip developers. At the time of conception (the early 80's) Grant Devine was the Premier of the Province of Saskatchewan and his deputy premier was Eric Berntson. He was also the MLA for the Souris-Cannington constituency in the extreme S.E. corner of the province.It was the fifth year of their first term of mandate the P.C. gov't had to call an election in the spring of 1987. Some of these blue chip notables and some key P.C. members were lining up about $225 million in 1987 dollar value behind me to run against Eric Berntson.First, because they felt I had been well connected in my blue-chip careers thus far, that and as well, because they didn't want to vote for Eric Berntson again. Why? Recent to the impending election call Eric Berntson was in the news for alleged improprieties to his adopted teenage daughter. The next thing you know people are wanting me to run against him. But before we could get a campaign under way his adopted daughter gets thrown in a mental hospital and three of Eric Berntson's closest political associates trump up 3 criminal charges on me. As a matter of some incorrect paperwork and a paper-shuffle I was unable to defend myself and have the charges defended in court because before you knew it, I was thrown in a mental hospital too. Several years later I found out from a lawyer that there was a very notable misdelegation of due process that had me thrown in a mental hospital so I couldn't run against Eric Berntson.After his re-election and subsequent promotion to a federal Senator under their Rt.Hon. Brian Mulroney, he eventually had justice catch up with him hence he served time in jail on fraud charges to do with political pay-offs and influence-peddling and the like.Eris Berntson was known to be a crude, vulgar at times, populist bully who never was on the up and up.Back to my charges and the trip to the mental hospital I got railroaded and diagnosed as a schizophrenic by a doctor whose hospital was receiving millions of dollars as a result of Eric Berntson's gov't. Yes I was railroaded by a complicit psychiatrist who was part of Berntson's political takedown of me.I wasn't hearing voices and I hadn't ever been. That's part of a schizophrenic diagnoses. As well as not hearing voices I displayed none of the other characteristics that went along with the complicit and corrupt psychiatrist's diagnoses of me.After I got out of the hospital my phone had stopped ringing for my busy little business. The horrible medications they forced me to take for a gross misdiagnosis were debilitating and mental disorientating.As a result, instead of continuing on with a burgeoning and successful business and political career in my late 20's I got forced onto a disability pension and fell out of touch with my crowd of business associates.So ""Amazing Place"" and all the economic diversity that had been planned for S.E. Sask never happened because the people involved didn't want to have anything to do with Eric Berntson's vision for S.E. Sask. His view was to build up the oil industry at the benefit of his tight little club and everyone else go fend for themselves. A short-sighted view of a red-neck, bully, populist.In the years since 1987 when I was taken out, life has been a struggle because of the stigma attached of being a mentally ill person. A misdiagnosis if there ever was one. I have busied myself in the years since 1987 as a sales rep, a bit of consulting on business projects, public relations roles for numerous clients in recent years and doing carpentry and construction projects.But I never gave up on the hopes of making Amazing Place a reality someday.Political dirty tricks by Eric Berntson back in 1987 prevented it from happening back then. However Eric Berntson passed away on September 23, 2018 and now that his band of cronies no longer have a need to protect their beloved Eric anymore I'm putting forth this crowdfunding campaign again, called ""Amazing Place""I never had the chance to run for MLA in 1987 because of Eric Berntson's dirty tricks to protect against his alleged improprieties to his adopted daughter and numerous other things.So if anyone would like to see ""Amazing Place"" become a reality, if you would like to be part of a moment of letting the people in general decide as opposed to a corrupt few then please donate. There was international interest in the project and Berntson knew I would've beat him election day. Instead, he peddled influence, trumped up charges and had his daughter and then I systematically thrown in mental hospitals to cover up his dirty laundry.So if you want to be part of a grass roots movement, where you can be part of a movement and a project that is of benefit to everyone, not just an elitist few industrialist corporation's and individuals, then donate to ""Amazing Place""I'm looking for volunteers and manpower and when it's built it will be how the people want it done, at a grass roots level not just a vision of some select self-serving elitist few.Yes you will find things a little in question in the remainder of this entry called ""Amazing Place"" however I decided I would try for some controversy.For years I have lived under the restrictions of the mental health act and all the ridiculous red-tape of it all. A system where the professionals involved are bent on keeping patients rather than giving them a clean bill of health because that reduces their case-load which reduces their income. Yes a corrupt system, but I'll address that some other time.So being a resourceful sort and turning a negative into a positive for the benefit of everyone, here's what's going on in ""Amazing Place"".The system was bent on putting a ""mental"" diagnosis on me, when it was nothing more or less that a dirty political cover-up.Therefore if the system is bent on calling me crazy for the sake of their self-serving job security then lets work with that. Let's use it to our advantage as a drawing card and a curiosity item as you encourage others to visit this ""Amazing Place"" page.If there's going to be a ""mental"" aspect to it then do it to our advantage for the news worthiness and controversy.In the following pages there will be a rather glib but responsible claim to possibly being the second coming of Christ. I no more think that of myself than any other Christian.The second coming of Christ is the collective uplifting of love in everyone’s hearts. The definition of Christ is: the divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all mankind.There for no man or woman who has Christ in their heart is anymore or less important than the next or the other.So if you want to see ""Amazing Place"" built as it would've been some 35-40 years ago except for being stopped to protect a crooked and questionable political career, then donate.You’ll come to a sentence where it says I had a deadline to raise some $800,000 for the property. The deadline doesn't apply anymore. The land is being held for me.I'm looking for donations, investment and fundraisers. If anyone out there raises funds for me I'll give 10 -15% back to the fundraisers in commission.Be part of a grassroots movement where the people decide. Read and decide whether someone with a ""mental"" issue could've written ""Amazing Place"" or not. If you decide I deserve a chance to build the project then donate and bring others to the site as well. Perhaps we'll have a vital and viral campaign as our success.Eric Berntson died on Sept 23/2018. He put my life on hold in the spring of 1987 and cut short some life’s dreams of mine and others at that time. These many years later, I hope to build ""Amazing Place"" and make the economic development plan come about again for the people of S.E. Sask. There's more to building a economy than to focus on just resource based industry. There's trade, manufacturing, secondary education, entertainment, the arts and tourism a true diversity of potential that has been most sorrowfully ignored these last 40 years and are needed here more than ever. Needed to provide jobs so people have more of a choice for a livelihood other than moving away to a city and watch small-town Saskatchewan just get smaller.Donate to this movement.Donate to this cause.I've been capable of building this project for 35 - 40 years. Now it's time to get on with it.So now if you get on with reading ""Amazing Place"" and help in whatever way you can it will be greatly appreciated. Let's leave something to benefit people for generations to come. God BlessSo what do you think? Should we have an ""Amazing Place"" to benefit the world and a sustainable future, in a world of peace and peaceful coexistence.I think so. I've brought the idea up again after close to a 40 year delay. Let's get us back somewhat to a time and a world and headspace that wasn't bent on war and conflict but rather on hope and interactional development and cooperation.A time of Harmony, somewhat.Thank you for reading this.Thank you for realizing I can't do it by myself and donating to the cause.And without further adieu read my original entry entitled ""Amazing Place"" Enjoy!I open this funding page with a quote by Charles Herbert Spencer - 18th Century scientist and philosopher.""There is a principal in life which is a bar against all informationWhich can be used as proof against all argumentsAnd cannot fail to lead to a life of everlasting ignoranceThat principal is contempt, prior to investigation""As you read the rest of this funding request read it through to the end. At the end of it only determines whether you have contempt or consideration for it. Also at the end consider if there is value for the money from what you got out of it by reading it.Either in entertainment, intrigue, value or sense of purpose by donating. If you see a value gained then donate and fund this page accordingly.Hello! My name is Lynn & Thank you for coming to my crowd funding proposal called ""Amazing Place"", which is to be a real estate, cultural, educational, religious, recreational, entertainment and organic farm development.People want value for their money. That being said if you would like to base the size of your donation on value you get out of reading at this site, be it $2, $5, $10, or whatever amount, if nothing else base it on the worth value you get from the Poem that is written at the end of this entry. It is a poem of insight and unique perspective that allows one to feel right about oneself in their day-to-day. A reward to you for reading this entry in its entirety. So if Amazing Place gets the millions of dollars from this site at $2, or $10 or whatever at a time, then that will be the case and with the Peace of Mind that all donors got value for their money.That being said please also refer to the Glen Ewen General Store which gives a bit more on my background and related experience which leaves me capable of building ""Amazing Place""Why did I write this you may ask? After 62 yrs of living I just feel like having my say so and get some things off my mind. For those of you old enough to remember a well-known movie of the mid 70's called Network starring Peter Finch as Howard Beale. A news anchorman who was ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore"", that demonstrates the hidden mood of a lot of people again these days some 40 yrs later.So this is my once every 62 yrs vent of my feelings. By no means do I have any intentions of following in the footsteps of Howard Beale in the movie but by mentioning the movie, it does demonstrate some of my concerns and dissatisfactions with some aspects of the world as it is today. So therefore I propose Amazing Place as the project and solution to some of the needs this world has today and how we all can participate to be part of this project and social movement as the outcome. Please read on to the end. Remember there's a reward at the end if you do. And hopefully you will see the value for the money should you decide to contribute and participate in this project.As follows:My full name is Lionel Lynn Johnson. Born August 15th, 1955. Born in the middle of the night, middle of the month, middle of the decade, in the middle of the 20th century in the middle of the continent. I'm just a middle of road kind of guy.Middle of the road in the regard that you always have to evaluate both sides of an issue before drawing a sensible conclusion. And realize even after the point of conclusion there is still plenty of room for discussion. LOLAccording to history, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace died at the age of 33 and apparently there are clues in the Bible and from seers that 1988 was likely the year for his return to become King. August 15, my birthday was also the first day of Woodstock, the large peace festival which was held in the state of New York in 1969 which launched a great spin-off of peace initiatives in the world.Aside from being born on the same day as a day of Peace, August 15, my birth sign, Leo, is of a king, my first name, Lionel, is reference of a king, and my last name refers to a king. Johnson King John's son. Of course the King John who gave us the Magna Carta in 1215. The Initial Charter and start of Western Civilization and of the democracies we have in it's evolution.As well I am the man who would be king of one of the clans of this area. I was also 33 in 1988 when I was officially confirmed into the United Church of Canada as a member. I grew up in the United Church and upon leaving home at 18 for many years when not regularly attending church I lived the life of a gnostic. In simple terms the individual Christian voice. I kept the 10 commandments as my guide and reference as best I could and only focused on the Red Letter words of Christ in the Bible (KJV) as part of my sensibilities.In later years I attended the Anglican Church and now attend a private independent assembly of worshipers and believers. As a result of my association with the United and Anglican churches for many years I also support the Universal Catholic assembly. As a result of my coincidental entry back to organized religion at the age of 33 in 1988 as the seers said it might happen. I wish to make note I do support the Pope.In Matthew 24 of the Bible it is said that the coming of the Lord to take power would be accompanied by a streak of light in the sky from the east to the west and that no one would know of his time of coming but the Father, perhaps not even the man himself. In the spring 1996, the comet Hyakutaki crossed from east to west in the sky for the first time in recorded history. At the same time I took power over a major continental issue being the primary voice that stopped a large toxic-waste incineration project that would have poisoned millions of people, millions of acres of farmland and water supplies. Yes I was and still can be an environmental activist.In the spring of 1997, the comet Hale-Bopp came as a streak of light from east to west for the first time in recorded history. At the same time I took power back over my life and away from the authorities. This was necessary because in opposition to the toxic waste incineration project the authorities tried to punish me for protecting the earth and its inhabitants by trying to ruin my credibility by creating lies that had me put in a Mental Hospital. This was an attempt to get the incineration project back on board for the sake of money instead of common sense. A green peace executive told me during my stay in the mental hospital ""Don't worry. You can't consider yourself a true environmental activist until you've had at least one trip to the mental hospital"" Lol. They failed and I and the planet won because the waste incinerator project got cancelled.Now where am I going with all this is not to say or claim that I might be the Second coming of Christ. I make no claim on that. I'm just putting forth these circumstances and coincidences in my life to show why I live as just a man and I live simply as a reminder that we are to live in Peace and have no reservations in accepting Jesus Christ as my savior or as an influence in predicating my actions in life.Mathew 24 says no one would know of his time of coming. Perhaps not the man himself not anyone.The true definition of Christ does not refer to the human form. It refers to the ""divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all mankind. That being said, it is my contention that perhaps the second coming of Christ for mankind is the collective uplifting of love and peace through all mankind. With reference to the book of Revelation that ""nation rise up against nation"", why should it not be shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, not fist to fist.If in fact I am he, I will not and will never know it or believe it. All I will believe is that with all the acts of war and terrorism and social unrest and difference in the world that times are getting very uncertain. So much so that leaders are logisticizing and ramping up to a nuclear world war to end North Korea's war initiative. Another unfortunate case of the tail trying to wag the dog.So I say before it's possibly too late I'd like to do my part in starting a peace initiative that others might wish to take part in.How I am going to start it is by building a rural hotel, sanctuary, healing and family retreat complex. The first phase will cost $40,000,000As far as time frame, the first $800,000 must be raised by the first of June 2018 to secure the land, and to keep things on schedule.The next phase will be the building of the lodge, the combination concert hall, meeting, congregation, wedding and worship facility and the private cabins which will be situated around the central facility.Also there will be plans for riding stables and arena, an animal farm, trotting racetrack and stadium, golf course, and an organic farm corporation.The theme will be of a country retreat. Where people can listen to country and western performances and a traditional approach to life. There will be area farms participating, so that people can go out on hayrides, camp fires, ride a tractor or a combine and show the kids some of the rural life with bus tours and car rides in the country. That is of course when they aren't in the pool or on the water slides or being taken to the local skating rink in the winter.It will be a place where all are welcome and hosted for all their many needs. As far as the healing aspect people will be able to come for natural healing by qualified practitioners.For myself I provide products from: Anovite.com/superfood. Where you can find the #1 rated most nutritionally dense and complete food supplement on the planet. This ancient superfood has been known as ""the promise of life"" for centuries. This line of colostrum, corrects a condition in the body that is an affliction 85% of the population. When the affliction is corrected it provides all the building and constituents blocks and stem cell production for the body to correct and to help heal over 400 known autoimmune disorders. Be they mental, arthritis, MS, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, fatigue, stress, heart disease, blockages, cholesterol, fibromyalgia, weight control and much more.Scientific research concludes with the proper nutrition and environment a human should live to a 130 years of age and older. This product reverses aging and is the proper nutrition to extend a healthy life years beyond what one might expect.So there you have it. I want Peace and Peaceful Coexistence to come back to this world and my rural Hotel/Resort will be the model of this ""world community village we strived for after WW11. The war to end all wars supposedly. Now we've been ramping up since 9/11 and after 17 yrs of the struggle against terrorism it almost looks like the terrorist have already won by the turmoil the world is in. I want to build a sustainable meeting, holiday, healing center that is based on an old mantra of decades ago when I was young, an attempt to re-visit the "" world community village"" that my generation strived for in our youth.Unfortunately forces have taken the world away from that time and it's time to bring it back.You may think I'm crazy or eccentric at the very least but when you listen to some of our world leaders ramping up for world war and nuclear confrontation maybe we should all call for peace and do our part to participate in my particular supposed craziness.What if every person in the world decided to forgive and forget and woke up tomorrow in a non combative frame of mind. No need for war or terrorism and the world would be at Peace. It's as simple as everyone stop fighting and show tolerance for our differences not animosity. It's that simple. We could spend our time and money on technology to stop global warming and on green energy infrastructure and really save the planet.However if these are the times of the revelations, lets counter it by building a Peaceful getaway out here on the prairies. And when the 144,000 of the twelve tribes of Israel get done sorting it out in the middle east we can "" invite them all over to break bread on the patio at the hotel and encourage multicultural harmony not rivalry. Perhaps people will be dancing in the streets come that day.Who knows we get one working model going and then build more. This project will be totally off the grid with wind/solar power and hydrogen generator technology. At least we'll do our part for the planet though some world leaders turn a blind eye and refuse to their part.Should you decide to help fund me, I accept it with gratitude, humility and should you come see the place some day you will be greeted, welcomed with respect and dignity. Should you decide not to help out that's ok but please do me the favor of referring others to this page and help get the word around.Recommended reading:The Celestine Prophecy - James RedfieldA Return to Love - Marianne WilliamsonBringers of the Dawn - Barbara Marciniak7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen J Covey""Imagine all the people, living life in Peace.You may say I a dreamerBut I'm not the only one.""John Lennon - The BeatlesGo in Peace Harm No One- Jesus ChristSo folks let's have a bit of fun doing this. When a person takes themselves too seriously that's when problems arise.If 10% of the Christians on the continent of North America all gave me $1.75 each I reach more than my total of $45,000,000. And if you all shared this on Facebook it could happen.If those of you who wished to participate in this project have no congregation that you attend on Sunday, perhaps you might come to this site and make a regular Sunday by Sunday donation in absence of supporting a congregation. Support the ""Amazing Place""A place built on the principles of peace, world community village, equality, and harmony.Once it is built this place of sanctuary and harmony it will embed into the rest of the world a living mantra to hopefully send it. A middle of the road kind of guy who has a sense of humor and just wants the world to lighten up a little. God knows its needed. That's why he told me to say so. Nudge nudge wink wink. My lawyers, Accountants, Architect and the like are in place and a very large hotel chain interest is in the background. Having said that the general over all theme of this development will be an attempt in appearance, character, personality of the late 50's to the late 60's. It was post war the world was relatively at peace and it was a time when the people and the land were relatively in harmony and everybody had hopes and dreams and expectations for the future. We had a strong growing middle class there was always enough to go around and people still made a point of making sure everyone was helped out. Things were still pretty traditional. Music and architecture and home life not unlike the old classic movies. There was a mood of tolerance benevolence and inspiration towards life and progress in general. People felt safe and secure whether it was with their neighbor next door or family or a stranger they met on the street. This is what we wish to embody in this development and attitude towards achieving the end goal and presentation of ""Amazing Place"".We may be able to promote other developers to join in and build something not unlike a small scaled down Branson, MissouriThe sky is the limit. It all starts with an idea.""Build it and they will come""- Field of DreamsSome might be curious about this following point about me. I live as a celibate heterosexual. Decades ago I could have said a gentleman but today no one would get it anymore and I believe that sexual intimacy and love making be between a man and a woman within the institution of marriage. It has been God's wish that marriage is between a man and a woman. Those that would want to change that to include homosexuals are going against God's wish and allowing the tail to wag the dog. Too much of that these days. Homosexuals can have recognized civil unions and be accepted as Christians but I don't approve or recognize an act of marriage between them. It's against God's wish.If you give a donation or not here's an insight that is priceless.How to acquire Peace of mind and feel God's Love:Sit back relax, a few deep breaths then passively and acceptingly feel the emotion of something loving and something beautiful and put those two feelings together.Example:A memory from your youth of being with friends or family and seeing the presents under a beautiful Christmas tree on Christmas morning. At the instant you combine the emotions of love, peace and beauty you will feel a Peace of Mind.If it's a surprise to you when the peaceful sensation happens don't become aggressive towards it because the feeling disappears. You must remain passive and patiently accepting for the feeling of Peace to stay. It takes practice to master it so you can have Peace of Mind all the time.Another insight:Reality is one extreme or the other or somewhere in between. Up or down, happy or sad, good or evil, giving or taking, selfish or generous, stoic or arrogant and so on.Basic psychology only has 2 emotions Love or Fear, or rather Love going the opposite way.So a person goes to or from something in love or feel or neutrality or indifference.From these basics and predicated by the 10 commandments in interpretation a person can figure out or determine what's up or what's best about just about anything and if uncertain about the choice of actions you can use this basic system to figure things out. So with reality as between 2 extremes and with 2 basic emotions how do we exist, within that binary system.I choose to live moving forward, spiritually upward in a caring , considerate, productive and benevolent and helpful regard. All in an effort of achieving Peaceful positive synergy and harmony with the world and people around me. I feel resolved and confident in this state.My politics are similar to my driving habits. I stay close to the middle of the road but a bit off to the right (right minded as opposed to right wing) and some times I use the left lane to bypass some obstacle on the right that slows me down or makes good sense to do so. And I do contend that if you get too far to either side of the road you'll end up stuck in the ditch going no where in a hurry.It's always a case of staying centered and balanced in your determinations of what is truth and what is just and right.""Everything that exists is real""""Anything that is real need not feel fear""""There in lies the Peace of God""From the bookA course in MiraclesI might add to that ""If you feel fear where you're at then where you're at isn't real""""So move in mind or place to a place that gives you Peace.""I'm putting out a call particularly to the baby boomers to help me. Act now and join the cause so we don't become a wasted, forgotten, ineffective and insignificant generation for what we once all believed in like peaceful coexistence may all be lost if we don't remind the world again what our generation stood for or all may be lost. I think otherwise. That's why I want to make this project and frame of mind amongst all people Hopefully you do too. Let's make the difference we are supposed too. So again thank you for your time reading this and again ""Go in Peace, Harm No One""Jesus Christ""Live Long and Prosper""SpockIt maybe the devil or it may be the LordBut you're going to have to serve somebodyBob DylanI choose to serve the Lord.And yes I may be psychic because: ""I can tell by the way you're thinking about me that you don't know whether I'm the real thing or not"" LOLIf I am all I can say is I sure wish they had twin blade razors back 2000 yr ago.""Hope is the greatest antidote for fear""Let us all hope for Peace Everlasting and a sensible outcome in the affairs of this chaotic world. To all you baby boomers out there, we grew up as the generation of Peace and Love"". Let's all live it.Be the change you want to see in the world today.Mahatma GhandiThank you for getting through my some what elongated. Slip of the mind. LOLI do have the practical life expression as to make ""Amazing Place"" a reality and in the midst of all of it keep it fun, and inspirational for everyone. We take the project seriously but not too serious within the project.When you get too serious about anything it takes the versatility of the mind and the heart away to stay inspired and fulfilled in doing a good and beneficial job of anything. That being said, spread the word, create some controversy over this great mystery at hand. Will ""Amazing Place"" come to be ? Always the conundrum. Maybe this sounds a bit off beat or as a departure from the popular approach of divide and conquer, choose up sides, exploit and capitalize that goes on with others these days.Hopefully cool heads will prevail and this Amazing Place will be built in recognition that working and coming together can work instead of divide and conquer.Amazing Place, taking us back to where we should not have left bringing us in to the future with a sustainable followable path. Let's see this place built to show that nice people and their efforts don't have to necessarily finish last.""A hotel, sanctuary, healing, entertainment, vacation, sports, equestrian, place of gathering and worship. Built on the premise of equality, world community, village, love, peace, benevolence and an effort of bringing people together, not by dividing and conquering as some hotel operators would do out there, amongst other things. This project will be a success built on bringing people peacefully together, in the common good, not dividing, conquering and chaos. There will be something for everyone and at an affordable admission price.Now that we're close to the end of this account of request for help in the way of money and as to why, let me state the following:I don't really need 10's of millions to make Amazing Place become a reality. I really only need perhaps 3 million dollars. Enough to purchase the required land and the balance to promote, get marketing and design the concept and then leverage the balance of the money with in visitors participating in the long run. If the money fund raised is in an amount that exceeds the initial 3 million dollars then farm land shall be purchased to start an organic farm corporation to help feed the guests and the world in general. With decent edible food instead of the over processed, chemically doctored food we are almost obligated and forced to eat today for lack of other choice. And as far as me being the second coming, please don't take me too seriously, but take the concept of peaceful coexistence and love amongst man and woman kind is what is intended as the outcome put into the present once Amazing Place is built.Take the project seriously but don't get carried away with too much else.It's all in the name of having some hope having some fun and controversy and goodwill amongst all men as the outcome.Let Amazing Place, it's intent and process be the quantum shift the world needs.A project of bringing the world together in Peace with a common belief in harmony as opposed to the present state of divide and conquer, chaos and threat of nuclear confrontation.Let us all be light hearted and hopeful that Amazing Place soon becomes a reality. Nothing but good will be the outcome of our actions on building ""Amazing Place""Let us all enjoy the task at hand of making it happen. If any opposition to the project or myself arises go tell someone else...After all I'm a lover not a fighter. lolThank you and may you and your future be blessed.Everyone now go and figure. Always the Conundrum lolSo there we have it folks. A proposal to build a project called ""Amazing Place"". To be built for a gathering place for people in the event that a place is required for the Second Coming of Christ to participate.Again I am not claiming to be the 2nd Coming only that I have had coincidences in my life that make others and myself casually quires at the possibility. So if I am not he, and he does show up we'll have a place for him. As well I am not a false prophet for I make no prophecies to speak of. Only that the Second Coming of Christ, yes Christ, by definition the light of Divine Love that is thread through all of us, be apparent, abundant and necessary for the return of Christ to Earth.So why do I attempt to make Amazing Place a reality? I refer to a popular remark of Dr. Wayne Dyer (well-known spiritualist and author) who says,""Don't die with the music still inside of you""Amazing Place will be my version of a harmonious job site and project for the heart and soul. A composition, bricks, mortar, healthy organic farmland, hotels, concert and congregation halls, recreation, education, healing and culture all done in cooperative concert with nothing but good but to come of it.That being said let us refer to the lyrics of a fitting song that suits my mood, my sense of humor and in some sense the mental space of many of the baby boomers o my generation. He's an Old Hippieby the Bellany BrothersLet's make Amazing Place a reality. If for no other reason than it will give us a fun project to work on for the next many years and keep life interesting. One more song lyric to keep in mind Don't worry be happyby Bobby McferronIf they make this into a movie some day, ""I hope it's a comedy"" lol Now here is The Poem I promised to you at the top of the page. A little reward for completing you task a job well done.- ""The Man Without Money (or) Don't Let The Joke Be On You""The man without money is not the man who is broke.Not like the man who can't laugh at a well-meaning joke.People will eat and people will drink and people will eat, drink, and smoke.And some will even deprive or indulge until they nearly choke.Others might lie, cheat, steal, confront or deliberately provoke.Looking to answer the questions that life will invoke.I think here is truth in these words which are spoke.It is always best to focus one's own personal God-given talents.On that which gives life timing, truth, honor, coordination, just cause, just intent, harmony and balance.So please realize there's nothing that badly broke.If you can still laugh at a well-meaning joke.And should you deal fairly, deal honestly with people, not with bullish tactics and greed.The reputation that comes to precede you will be your true fortune indeed.Believe in these words, belief in them is a must.For it gives you a place and a focus that is just, that others will trust.And you'll find you never feel that you will ever lose face.A you walk on through life in a state of Peace, and a state of Dignity and Grace.So please realize there's nothing anywhere near broke.If you can still laugh at a well-meaning joke.Should you try the thought of these lines if only for the heck of it.You'll find you never have to live in spiritual deficit.And for those who don't believe these lines to be possibly true.I tell you my friend the joke is most certain on them not on me, not on you.The EndSo there we have it folks. Value for the money. Donate whatever you deem the value of the poem. Focused and Fine. ""Five bucks for a fine and feisty frame of feeling"", perhaps? lol Or the value of the dream of a place of peace and amazement and being part of helping in the building of ""Amazing Place"". At attempt to bring peace to the world and resolve conflict. All money received is received with humble appreciation, respect and utmost state of responsibility and determination and dedication to get the project done. It will be built by benevolence and goodwill, and so shall it exist and operate in many regards once built.Why will it be an ""Amazing Place""? It will, because of amazing and abundant response to this project that it will help create jobs, heal people, heal the land, give the contributing people of the world something to take part in. A real cause.Everlasting peace and harmony amongst the people of the world. And a sustainable planet, environment, ecosystem, and political climate. Yes an Amazing Project, Place and Movement.""Amazing Place""Achievable conceivable $2, $5, $10 at a time. Make a game of how many you can bring to the site. Maybe the $40 million will be here by summer next summer or several summers after that. You never know. We'll just make it a pet project of ours to save the planet. No matter how long it takes. Let us all ""rise to the mountain tops to see the Promise Land"" - paraphrase of Dr. Martin Luther King.Maybe you should leave a couple of bucks behind just in case I might be the second coming. I can use it for getting rid of the possible bad issues and bad guys that might come to be or in fact might already be. Refer to Revelations in the bible.The anti Christ has the number 666 associated with him. The address 555 - 5th Ave NY, NY belongs to a building owned by a well known billionaire. ( go out and google to see who it is) On one floor of that building is a company called Lucifer Technologies. They are the developers of micro-chip technologies that are already being put in humans for identification purposes in some companies. Bearing the mark of the Beast of the earth so to speak.There's a large banking computer in Brussels, Belgium that apparently has been accumulating and recording everyone in the world banking system and giving them a number. A triple six digit coding system is at the bottom of it. This computer is speculated to be the Beast of the Earth by some. Intended to take away a person's independence's, rights and freedoms in so many ways. With a few of these apparencies one can only speculate as to the implications or the outcome. One can only wonder.I draw no conclusions other than to be wary of these present day activities and to make my efforts as best I can to help the planet through these unsettled times and to work for the best outcome and resolve for as many as possible. I draw no conclusions on the afore mentioned people or places perhaps. Judge not lest you be judged.So if you'd like to help me out, just in case, your contribution will be appreciated in the utmost.Am I the Second Coming. Who knows for sure. No one ever will probably. All I can say is why did God lead me to notice the coincidences in my life that lead me and others to wonder if I really might be.Go figure.I wish no one any harm, and one purpose of mine is to appeal to the U.S. and N. Korea to de-escalate their confrontation.Ramped up much further and everyone on the planet is a loser in some regard as a result of what could transpire.An old 1960's montra went as follows:Make Love Not War. So since 9/11 it has been ramping up with more and more rivalries, conflicts and animosities in the world than ever before.Remember the rather hopeful calm and progressive confidence there was in the world and a general state of over all well-being before 9/11.All I can ask now is whatever happened to Make Love Not War?People, people, people, where is the love that once was?People, people, people, where is the love.Remember in order to save the world it has to be a group effort. Everyone sharing in the satisfaction of doing something worth while. There may be a very significant need for a world effort for peace and a disarming of minds and battlefields. If you are going to donate I will close with this poem called."" The joke is on You"" or ""The Man Without Money"" as you prefer. If after hearing/reading it  gives you a sense that everyone is ok in the thought and it's a good way to lift the spirits. Then give this project what you think the poem is worth. How about Five Bucks For The Feel Good Factor. lolHelp save the world for $5. The outcome of doing so will be heavenly.This may come as madcap or tongue in cheek reading to you in some regard. I try to keep it lighthearted and humorous but only to be good medicine to the mind. But please be rest assured any donation received and no matter how many millions raised or other assistance provided it will be received with the utmost of respect, humility, care, responsibility and conscientiousness. So thank you ahead of time.Lynn Johnson just a middle of the road regular kind of guy who wants to do something meaningful for the world. In the words of a Paul Simon song ""Don't want to end up a cartoon in a cartoon graveyard""""Peace"" is the theme of this year's Winter Olympics on at this time. Valentine's Day is near so I thought I'd release this to coincide with a time of Love and Peace in the world. As an attempt to bring back even more love and peace to the world and in the years to come. For the love of the planet, the people and all creation.We are all custodians of this planet. Let's take collectively better care of it than we have of late, environmentally, socially, politically. People! People! People!Where is the Peace we all once knew? Especially before 9/11Let us recover and recapture and contribute the missing peace in the building of Amazing PlaceAs for myself I am a low key ,retiring sort who lives a basic, practical life on a small gov't pension, an occasional commissioned sale of green energy with a wind turbine company at www.kelsoenergy.com , some odd jobs and the occasional bit of design and reno carpentry projects. I also buy and sell a bit of used practical and collectible goods I seem to get by and the money that I make helps to look after my 87 year old mother and others that I give help to when I have the change to spare.I guess that's why I have to ask the world to help me in this campaign for mine was spent helping others already. I ask the world for its help so that I can repay the world back by helping reestablish a place in it of peace and love that shall spread through out the world for the day to arrive of everlasting peace.I am not an extravagant or wasteful man and I consider myself quite practical most of the time and that is how I will deal with all funds raised for Amazing Place.So please contribute to this cause, this movement. Ask others to come to this site and do likewise. Make a difference.Nothing ventured, Nothing gained! Let's attempt to make this site experience visitors in a viral, spiral. lol No I'm not crazy and I haven't slipped a gear. It's just a case that the older one gets the more they tend to speak what's on their mind and in their heart than what you think the world expects of you. I guess that's true in my case.Besides i was curious what would come of it if I did do as I have just done , namely releasing this campaign called""Amazing Place"" That and the need to keep life hopeful and interesting for as many as possible.Join the cause and the movement, make a difference, and at least say you tried and gave it an honest attempt Nothing ventured, Nothing gained.If nothing else I hope I have given you food for thought. I hope that they're heavenly thoughts. LOLAnd have a happy and abundant life.I don't ask in you giving a donation that you choose to believe in me as the second coming. I ask you to donate in your belief in God, in love, in peace, good will toward your fellow man and respect for the creatures and all life on the planet.Amazing Place will come to be, not for me, but for everyone who believes in Christ, in the Divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all God's creation.Amazing Place and this planet will be for everyone who comes in Peace and God's love which is Christ. All contributions to this project are to be administrated by a Christian Organization in background. This organization exists as a independent congregation and benevolent charitable organization and is registered as such with gov't and CRA. Conducting activities such as Amazing Place is just one of it's projects.So give and be a part of ""Amazing Place"", a part of something bigger than us all, a ""movement"" refreshed and renewed in the direction of ""Everlasting World Peace"". We've been a state of escalating conflict and war in the world since 911.Let's face it world leadership in many regards has become  ""bunker-lunky"".We need a quantum shift and a focused shift to world peace.Sign on with Amazing Place and make it a notable part of the world movement for Peace and World Community village. Sign on. You have to believe in and stand for something or you will fall for anything. Believe in and stand for Christ and Peace and in Amazing Place to be that vehicle. Believe and act or react upon this moment to make it happen and thanks for your time and donation to help spread the word and make Amazing Place and all it stands for a reality. Thank you.So now that you have read the entire entry do you see any value to it? If so, donate and fund accordingly and spread the word.If you take contempt that I might be the second coming. That the ominous consideration of the book of Revelations might well be right. That might be a just reaction. No one wants those occurrences to come about.I am simply hopefully that some of the spiritual sources I have been in touch with those seers claiming that the real second coming of Christ is not for another 3200 years or so. That there are powers and influences on this planet that are trying to concoct a false state of Revelations of this time of man that will be false Revelations, but destructive and tumultuous to man and the planet nonetheless I'm just trying to diffuse the situation as gently and tactfully as I only remain hopeful that the pendulum of war, chaos and conflict that is upon this world and I'm calling upon the help of others the help of the planet would be nice. If you decide to pitch in and donate and help it would be for a good cause. World peace, safety and sanctuary. May I please imply a sense of urgency in my request for help and spreading the word. ""Every one lives at the hands of the other mans mercy"" Hopefully the pendulum will soon start to swing the other way and there will be a peaceful sustainable outcome for us one and all in the process. Imagine all the peopleliving the life in Peace, you too. You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you join us and the world will live as one.John LennonSo there we all are. Close to the end of the appeal for funding of Amazing Place.Should you fund, look upon it as an act of contributing to a project that's intended to help save the world, if need be. With all the apparencies out there working towards the circumstances of the times of the Revelations it may well need be. I don't want the times of the Revelations and all it's horrors to occur any more than most. However there are forces and influences on this earth and in this universe that are bent on bringing these times upon us. Best to be prepared as best we can to keep the outcome what it is to be. A matter of playing it safe as best we can for a planet of everlasting peace.Food for thought Food for thought.Thank you for reading this entry and thank you in advance for your assistance in helping to bring a final lasting peaceful salvation to this planet.Food for thought food for thoughtPrepare for the worst, work for and hope and strive for the best.Footnote : It would be remiss of me not to mention death of Reverend Billy Graham (an American Evangelist) on Feb. 21, 2018.

There were never two sisters who were more passionate to be learning or eager to be growing in the wisdom and knowledge of God. They speak enthusiastically of what they are reading in Homer's Odyssey, practicing in Art, or studying in Euclid's Elements. They have hearts that love the Lord and long to know Him more. God led them here and we know and trust that He will keep them here for just as long as He wants.As Dean of the college, I hear a lot about the personal and family financial struggles. Several of these families and students are dealing with health issues, the economy, loss of jobs, etc. Students are working hard -- as much as 30+ hours a week -- some have had to go part-time in order to pay for school, and some prospective students are waiting on word of need-based aid to determine whether they can attend at all. But they work hard because they want to be here; they eagerly to desire to pursue wisdom and to pour themselves into their classes, their readings, and their community.Although tuition is low, many still need assistance.We hope to raise $30,000 for our need-based scholarship fund to assist these students, provide opportunity for spiritual formation, and send these students out as salt and light into the world around them as ambassadors of Christ and the gospel.Will you please prayerfully consider helping students like Julia and Tiffany and others?New College Franklin is a four-year classical Christian liberal arts school designed to disciple students with discussion-based education and mentoring for the purpose of growth in wisdom and missional living.

Vanessa Glavac ,"Montréal, QC",Community & Neighbors,"We are losing freedom of the press in Canada, and with it, our chance at fair elections.Canadian journalist Alan Forsythe was fired for reporting on the defamation of a local People’s Party candidate.

Vanessa Glavac ,"Vancouver, BC",Other,"We are very quickly losing freedom of the press in Canada, and with it, our ability to hold free and democratic elections.Just before the election, Canadian journalist Alan Forsythe was fired for reporting on the defamation of a local People’s Party candidate. He was fired outright - no warning, just summary termination.He was told he was fired for “bias”. Journalists at the same company were actively defaming right-leaning candidates with no consequences – but merely pointing out the bias got Forsythe fired. Donate now to defend journalists’ right to report truth, not propaganda. ----Canadians are well aware of the Liberal’s grants to media like the CBC, Global News and CTV.But few people realize that nearly all Canadian media is owned - and controlled - by just 4 government funded conglomerates: Black Press, Glacier Media, Torstar, and Postmedia. Forsythe hasn’t just been fired from one local media company – the left-leaning media cartel has blacklisted him from ever getting a job in the mainstream media again. They’re trying to end the career of one of the few journalists who dares to speak against the left-leaning narrative. This isn’t just an attack on Forsythe. This is an attack on the free press and on right-leaning journalists.  This is a chilling message sent to every one of Forsythe’s colleagues: If you speak out, we’ll ruin you. It’s also an effort to drive right-leaning journalists out of the industry, and eliminate any chance we have for fair coverage. Unless we fight back. This is why Forsythe is suing for wrongful dismissal. Forsythe doesn’t expect this lawsuit will win him any kind of fair compensation.

He could have negotiated with the union behind closed doors, with far less stress. He’s doing this to defend our free press, and he needs our help. Please donate to help us stand up to these bullies and take a stand against the biased, left-leaning media.","November 3, 2019",0,"$10,000 goal"
Peter Strong ,"Arncliffe, NSW",Community & Neighbors,"This fundraiser is an attempt at countering the all-pervasive media murder that the Murdoch empire has carried out and encourage the growing chorus of dissent into some action. We will produce a booklet and stickers encouraging for starters an Inner West Boycott of all Newscorp publications.  Stickers can be put on actual newspapers in cafes lampooning the propaganda and lies, whose up for a bit of coffee stop activism? also stickers and posters in the street. A 12-page booklet-zine will outline why we should take action and boycott Newscorp. These will be presented to cafes to encourage them to not stock Newscopr any more. The link between corporations and mining companies and government and media can be obviously seen in Murdoch's tabloid press here and overseas. The way Newscorp is presenting Scott Morrison and the LNP in our current Bush Fire crisis is counter to the growing chorus of anger against their ineffective rolling out of emergency measures as well as their defunding of fire services just before the crisis took hold. It's heartening to see so much dissent and sharing of articles and stories online and I would hope that this leads to some major anti-Morrison/Murdoch/Mining industry action around Australia in 2020.Scott Morrison won the election in 2019 mostly due to the massive propaganda that the Murdoch Mordor empire disseminated as well as Clive Palmer's campaign encouraging people not to vote for Labor. For years we have opposed the powers that be with their short-sightedness and greed, we have build up our communities with direct action and shared positivity with events, dances and online extended families. We weathered the Howard and Bush era's and breathed a brief sigh of relief when they were voted out and things turned slightly towards more conscious regimes.Now it seems apparent that the whole Labour/Democrat vs Republican/Tory/Liberal in the Western world has shifted to the right in order to panda to the sensibilities of the media who it seems are increasingly controlled by corporate interests. Now we have three dangerous men at the helm in the U.S.A, U.K and here in Australia.The Murdoch media machine has had a big part to play to manufacture public opinion in Australia, the U.K and U.S towards election outcomes favouring corporate interests.Countries like Canada and New Zealand where Murdoch press does not have a monopoly have left-leaning leaders, in the US, UK and Australia this is not possible as the press is so pervasive and bias towards the right-wing and its determination to drive us all off a cliff on the highway to hell. The ball is well in motion for interactive online media and a more level playing field in the ever more growing web where we all have a more informed voice but with FaceBook becoming more corporatised and targeted marketing during elections a step back has been experienced as we witnessed in recent Australian and UK elections. The potential exists for a mouse-driven democracy and decision-making process that will keep the pond of politics from going stagnant in the future but we're far from where we need to be to prevent the slide to a toxic planet for the future generations to inherit.The Morrison government is an embarrassing expression of Australia. Now is the time to get this conscious party started and take control of the future, What we have witnessed int he last decade are sad last-ditch attempts for control in changing times by the older generation, right-wing and mining lobbies who are desperate to channel wealth in the hands of the few at the expense of the quality of life for the future generations.Funds raised from this campaign will go to making stickers, posters and a booklet encouraging people in venues and cafes not to stock NewsCorp publications.","January 4, 2020",$840,$800 
Gary McHale ,"Binbrook, ON",Other,"Your Help is NeededHalton Conservation Authority v. Jean and Peter ThomasThe result of Jean and Peter loosing this case would result in fines and penalties in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  fines ($20,000) removal order ( $125,000)  legal costs and the prosecution will now be seeking there costs .Jean Thomas states, ""It’s been a long stressful journey on ourselves and our family. We have come so far doing this financially alone, with your help we will keep on fighting for our rights. we are standing up for all the wrong doing that conservation have done to so many people where there homes and land have been devalued and many times expropriated. This has to stop.  Please support us and help us stay strong. We have to win this it matters to us all. We must set a precedent. We can not loose for all our sake."" Thomas out $25,000 and $50,000 more is Needed:Ontario Provincial court isn’t designed for justice but for convictions. The Government doesn’t hire lawyers or paralegals to be Justices of the Peace and as such few have any legal training. These people sit in judgement with the ability to issue massive fines and imprisonment with little more than a degree in some liberal arts course.Jean and Peter have already spent over $25,000 including $6900 in court transcripts only to find out that court clerks destroyed the court copy and are demand that they buy three new copies of the transcripts. Additionally, to move forward they have hired a lawyer to file three new applications in court – one for the Court of Appeal, one for Superior Court and one for Provincial Court – which will cost an additional $50,000.Gary McHale, who has conducted the original trial in Provincial Court, will direct all funds to pay legal expenses. These expenses will be transcripts, any out of pocket costs to file material, legal fees both by representatives of Jean and Peter and any cost awarded against them by the court.Your Property Rights and Out of Control Government Agents:Fundamentally, this case is about basic property rights of average citizens and out of control unelected government agents who care little for average citizens and more about their own power and control over others.Purchase of Dream Home:Back in 2007 Jean and Peter purchased their dream home on 22 acres out in the country near Milton, Ontario. Much of the land was a forest that opened up to a home with a small barn that allowed them to have a few horses. In 2013, they decided to build a riding ring for their horses and were almost done when the Halton Conservation Authority came on their property and took control of the development.Unknown to Jean and Peter, Halton Conservation Authority had changed their regulations, without the knowledge of property owners and without any public oversight, so that all properties that were within 120m or 370 ft from any waterway or wetland were suddenly controlled by Halton Conservation. In the Burlington area this automatically transferred massive areas of private property to the control of Halton Conservation.For Jean and Peter this suddenly meant that Halton Conservation now claimed control over approx. 80% of their 22 acres of property.Six Year Harassment of Jean and Peter:Starting in 2013 Halton Conservation has spent well over $250,000 of taxpayers’ money to harass and prosecute Jean and Peter claiming the riding ring is on the 120m or 370 ft. of land that they regulate. Jean and Peter were charged with illegally developing on Halton Conservation regulated land which they owned.Ontario Justice of the Peace:The Ontario Government doesn’t hire lawyers or paralegals to be Justices of the Peace. Few have any legal training or understand basic legal arguments involving the Charter of Rights of citizens. For the most part the Provincial Offenses Court is designed to ensure the Justices simply go along with the prosecution to get maximum convictions.In the Thomas’ case the Justice repeatedly told the court how confused she was throughout the 10-day trial. The Justice failed to understand basic Charter issues, basic issues regarding contract law and basic issues regarding disclosure.This confused Justice found Jean and Peter guilty which has been appealed.Court Clerks Destroy Transcripts:In a prime example of how government employees don’t care one bit about average citizens, the court staff at the Burlington courthouse allowed the court copy of the transcripts that Jean and Peter paid for to be destroyed without their knowledge.On September 20, 2019 a Judge in the Provincial court marked the Thomas appeal as abandoned solely because she didn’t see any filed transcripts in the appeal file. While McHale provided proof that they had purchased the transcripts and directly told the judge the court staff were refusing to transfer the transcripts to the appeal file, the Judge abandoned the appeal.Jean and Peter would then find out the transcripts were not sitting in the original trial file but had been destroyed.All Citizens should be Outraged by the Injustice of the Burlington Court:We would have to post a novel to list out all the ways the prosecutor, the clerks, the justice of the peace and the judge from Sept. 20, 2019 have failed to uphold the proper administration of justice. The Burlington courthouse is one of the more outrageous courthouses in Ontario where staff simply don’t care how their actions affect individual cases and therefore affect individual citizens in Burlington. At each step through the system the staff are extremely unhelpful, and delays caused by getting transcripts – sometimes delays of 6 months or more – simply add undue stress to individuals.Thomas Legal Team:Gary McHale has conducted the Provincial cases. He has won at the Court of Appeal more than once and his rulings on Private Prosecutions are now binding on courts throughout Canada. McHale has successfully arrested uniformed police officers and successfully issued criminal charges against the highest-ranking officers in Ontario.McHale’s associate Randy Fleming recently won at the Supreme Court of Canada regarding how police target peaceful protesters at public events instead of arresting violent protesters who show up for the purpose of harassing and threatening average citizens who want to exercise their free speech rights in Canada.Lawyer Daniel Ciarabellini has joined the team to conduct the legal applications at the Court of Appeal and in Superior Court. While Ciarabellini has only been a lawyer for a short period of time, he has already established his passion to help average citizens by winning, as a law student, a case against a former homeless person who had over $65,000 in fines that had accumulated over the years.Ciarabellini is a brilliant lawyer willing to take on the establishment. The results of this case will greatly affect most cases in Ontario Provincial courts.","October 28, 2019","$1,960","$50,000 "
Lindsay Shepherd ,"Waterloo, ON",Education & Learning,"The Laurier Society for Open Inquiry, which was founded in January 2018 by Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU) graduate student Lindsay Shepherd, has over 180 members and has held numerous successful events in the Waterloo region in Ontario. LSOI hosts speakers from across the political spectrum. Some of our previous speakers include: -      James Kitchen, lawyer with the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms -      David Clement, libertarian and North American Affairs Manager with Consumer Choice Center-      Faith Goldy, former commentator with Rebel Media (note: this event was cancelled by a protestor pulling the fire alarm and never proceeded)-      Dr. Frances Widdowson, Marxist-socialist and associate professor at Mount Royal University, Calgary-      Andrew Lawton, writer and former candidate for the Ontario Progressive Conservatives LSOI’s next event is set to be Wed. October 24th, 7pm-8:30pm, on the Wilfrid Laurier University campus. The topic is “Does Trans Activism Negatively Impact Women’s Rights?”, and the presenter is the founder and editor of Feminist Current, Meghan E. Murphy. Feminist Current is Canada’s leading feminist website.  However, to host this talk about women’s rights, which will be presented by a left-leaning feminist, Wilfrid Laurier University is charging the Laurier Society for Open Inquiry $8,055 CAD. Yes, that’s right, $8,055 to discuss human rights and feminism on a university campus. Many try to frame the free speech on campus debate as a left vs. right or liberal vs. conservative issue, but this is simply not the case. Wilfrid Laurier University charged LSOI $5,331 to host leftist professor Frances Widdowson back in May 2018, which LSOI was able to successfully crowdfund through GoFundMe in 24 hours (thank you to all you wonderful and generous people who donated from all across the world!). Now, WLU has upped the ante, and are charging $8,055 for LSOI to host a leftist feminist writer who has an M.A. in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies. We won't let them intimidate and stifle us. The university charges LSOI excessive fees because they want us to have to pay for others’ ability to protest. The university is saying that LSOI, a group genuinely interested in hearing ideas from across the political spectrum, must use our own funds to pay for others to threaten our event! It is simply unjust.  When Wilfrid Laurier University has been previously confronted about their censorious security fees, they often try to diverge from the issue by pointing out that LSOI is not an “official” student group. This is true, but not because LSOI was denied by the student union or anything like that. At WLU, only undergraduate students can be executives and members of official student clubs. Graduate students do not have their own clubs, and they cannot hold positions within undergraduate clubs. Due to this bureaucratic overlook on WLU's part, and seeing as LSOI President Lindsay Shepherd and many other members are graduate students, we could not apply for official club status. However, we are obviously deeply rooted in the Laurier community – that is the school we formed out of.  Charging a student-based group $8,055 to host a talk about women’s rights is morally reprehensible and unprincipled. We would be so thankful if you can contribute anything to help us pay this $8,055 ransom. LSOI strongly believes we need to keep the spirit of free speech and open inquiry alive in our universities, and radical protestors should NOT be allowed to shut down politically incorrect views through their threats and violence. Unfortunately, universities enable these protestors, and we must do everything we can to succeed despite the obstacles they put us through. Thank you so much. Without your support, Wilfrid Laurier University would succeed in stifling open inquiry.","October 6, 2018","$2,862","$8,055 "
Jerry Martin ,"Whitewood, SK",Non-Profits & Charities,"Every single person of a certain age in this country has shared one common experience. We have needed to purchase medicine for ourselves, or someone we care for. Simple access to safe medicine is the difference between a painful night and easy dreams.Who am I? And why support this cause?My name is Jerry Martin and I dedicated the last 4 years to saving and bettering lives with cannabis medicine. I've donated over $150,000 of my former shop's profits back to the local community, and others in need worldwide. Now I need your help.On Tues Nov 8th 2016, after 4 years of helping my community with easy access to safe medicine, the Broadview police seized the contents of my cannabis dispensary, and everything I personally own.

In most cases, in order to make changes to law, and challenge a constitutional matter, one must first give up their freedoms and rights by being arrested.

Robyn & Kurt Holukoff ,"Kitchener, ON",Other,"Help us save our home and keep us safe!We are Kurt and Robyn Marie Holukoff, currently in Southern Ontario, near Toronto. Kurt was a professor at the University of Waterloo until he disclosed to the Head of the Department that we needed help because of problems due to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The Department laid Kurt off the next session. Robyn Marie is also disabled; she edits and is on social assistance. Shortly after getting laid off, the landlord got angry because we asked him to do landlordy things, and instead of doing what the law required, issued us an eviction notice. This is all in writing, and we went to hearing at the Landlord and Tenant Board.  Pretty much as soon as the officials at the Landlord and Tenant Board found out we were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, they apparently ignored everything we said and instead actually made up things they say we said in what seems like a bizarre attempt to tank our case. But we are fighting on in Court. Please help us save our home and stop landlords from abusing the system.Who we are: Kurt is a logician graduated from University of Waterloo with a phD in 2014; won the Social Sciences Humanities Research Canada award (SSHRC), and multiple Ontario Graduate Scholarships (OGS) for his ground-breaking doctoral research in using algebraic combinatorics to model political conflict/argument in liberal democracies. Robyn is a freelance editor, a past assistant editor of the incredible Lightspeed Magazine, and proud to have worked on Women Destroy Science Fiction! as well as Queers Destroy Horror! Both of us have multiple physical, mental and cognitive disabilities. We’ve been married for 17 years, just this past July. We have two cats who are almost as old as our relationship, Daphne the Dude and Seven the Sneaky and my Mobility Service Dog: His public name is Falcor, and he just turned three in July. The Situation: A full summary is available below but if you’re not into that, our Landlord tried to evict us last spring after we asked for human rights and safety stuff. We were ordered to evict, we worked and won a review, it was granted, and the landlord filed a new eviction the day after he lost the review hearing. We were so ill that we asked for time to recover from the LTB. No time was granted, and we went to a written hearing in April. We just got word that we lost. We want to appeal at Divisional Court. The Goals: What we’re asking for is financial support for our legal expenses. We’ve made it this far: through inaccessible hearings, the long work of putting together appeals at the LTB, and we’re proud of our achievements to date, but we’re run down from this long year, far more ill than we were when we started, and we’ve been unable to make our lives work under these conditions - I had been improving both physically and mentally the past few years - still severely disabled but my psychiatrist and I were talking about me going to school part time again in the future.  But now, our physician is clear that we aren't able to represent our interests in person.Printing/binding – 100 – we have a proceeding coming up, and we’re going to need colour pictures of the repair issues.Transportation – 290 – we have a car but it’s out of commission. We estimate the repair at 1500$. Fixing it would be ideal; I have specialist appointments out of town in March, our service dog team has recertification out of town the same month, and it destroyed our budget renting a car repeatedly to get to this point, but renting a few times will work with your help. The new funding goal represents rental costs, but dear The Internet, fixing our car would be really great.Mould/Air quality test - 900 – the landlord is refusing to give us the results, and we’ve got mould in the living room, kitchen and bathroom with air purifiers running 24/7 – a huge cognitive drain.  The landlord refused to remediate the mould; sprayed bleach on it in October, and it’s started to come back. The landlord also refuses to say in writing whether the apartment’s safe, and this would be an essential piece of evidence if we had the resources to get it. Also, omg, we’d really like to know. We’ve both been run down, sick, and exhausted, we’ve got pets, and we have no idea how our environment is impacting all of us.Court reporter – 800 – The gaps in the hearing recordings have caused a lot of mental and cognitive limitations in the two of us. For example, we can’t really listen to the previous hearing recordings without severe limitations being triggered. Our ability to self-represent has been ruined by this; engaging with the material we need to come up with arguments, to actually do the thing have gotten increasingly worse. We can't self-represent anymore. We’ve had the landlord’s legal stuff for the upcoming eviction hearing March 25 2020, and we’ve actually been unable to open it, unable to read it; we’re at the end of our abilities. Burnt. Out.Groceries – 350 – we’re short this month, and could really use healthy meals.Clothes – 30 – we’re both down to one pair of jeans each, and both pairs have holes.  We can get a couple of jeans and sweaters at a local thrift store. We could definitely also use socks!So, we estimate about 2390$ that we need for our future fight. If we went past this goal, we’d put money towards going to the specialist and the trip out of town for mobility service dog re-certification – basically, we do want to fix our car and if we could finagle that, a lot of stress would just evaporate. The transit situation is pretty good, but we have mobility issues; going to the store literally takes a full work day for us.We need your help right now to save our home! You can support us through this month while we get a lawyer, put together a case for a rent abatement, and it's not just us you're helping. If you help us stay housed, we’re sure you’re helping other people stay housed in the future. We’re appealing this in Divisional Court. If we win, we’re sure our case will be something other marginalized people, particularly disabled people, will be able to reference in their own fight for their shelter. We wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for people who fought stuff like this before and won. We've fought our way through to getting both a Legal Aid Certificate and an adjournment to find appropriate representation given our disabilities. Thank you so much for your support. Please help us find a lawyer who can make sure all this weird stuff doesn’t happen to others. Sometimes one court case can be a black swan event, can change things because no one sees it coming. We can be that black swan event, change how tenants and disabled people are treated. They won’t see us coming, not if You the Internet are in our corner. We have suffered through utterly unbelievable behaviour but we are confident that all that pain and bewilderment is just part of a “change the world” process. Sometimes the little guy can be lucky, beat the system and we feel very lucky. Please donate if you can find a way, and please help spread this fundraiser around.","September 16, 2019","$2,360","$5,000 "
Amanda Elaine Woods ,"Squamish, BC",Education & Learning,"About Me Hello there friends/family/loved ones,As many of you know, I attend a small liberal arts and sciences university called Quest University Canada in Squamish, BC on the unceded and ancestral territory of theSkwxwú7mesh (Squamish) First Nation. I am a mature student, and am putting myself through the program with student loans and my own income that I get from working 16 hours a week at a part-time retail job in downtown Squamish. I am in my second year of four-year bachelor's degree program. My academic interests are concentrated on decolonization, social justice and liberation. I'm not exactly sure where those interests will lead me, but the amazing thing about Quest is that I get to explore the things that light me up and turn them into a degree. About QuestQuest University is a private university, which means that tuition is not subsidized by the government. Per year, the cost for tuition alone is $35,000, not including living costs. I am fortunate enough to have access to scholarships and financial aid through the university, however my budget for housing and other living costs remains quite low. Despite the high cost, I am determined to find a way to finish out my degree here. There isn't another university out there quite like Quest, and with my ties to the community of Squamish, I don't intend on leaving anytime soon. https://questu.caWhy I Need Your HelpThere is currently a housing crisis in Squamish. Trying to find a place to live that would allow me to finish my degree without the stress of housing instability has been very difficult, and since the end of my first year of university, I have moved a total of 6 times within an 8 month period. As of January 2020 I will have been without a space of my own for over 3 months. During this time I have been staying with friends, however this is not a long-term solution. I am reaching out for financial help so that I can secure housing until the end of this semester (April 2020) and to help cover some living costs to offset the stress of my studies. Here's what your donation will be going towards;Rent (room in shared house) - between $700-$800 per monthPhone Bill - $80 per monthGroceries -  $150 per month","January 7, 2020",580 $,"5,000 $ "
Igor Blumer ,"Box Hill, South West England, United Kingdom",Education & Learning,"Help me attain an education to pursue a better future for all of us.Hello fellow critical thinkers and conscious doers!I stand on the cusp of the next chapter of my life and would like to invite you to assist me in opening new doors.Two months ago a dream came true for me. I was incredibly fortunate to be one of the small number of students accepted on a scholarship to Quest university  in Canada. Quest is a unique institution that follows a non-specialised curriculum that combines the sciences and liberal arts, enabling students to pursue a personalised learning goal. This connects deeply with my personal philosophy. My unconventional education thus far at Brockwood Park International School has given me a broad perspective of the world - history, art, philosophy and ecology - and a passion to make the world a better place. Quest University will enable me to make that a reality, and harness my skills and intellect for the greater good.However, in order to realise this vision I need your help. Quest’s financial aid will only pay my tuition. Being such an exclusive learning environment my family's situation is such that we would not be able to support this endeavour financially. I therefore turn to friends and strangers, fellow thinkers and doers, believers in the potential of youth to achieve a better world. Your support will bring about a life changing opportunity for me to contribute in a constructive and meaningful way.My passion and vision for the future:My goal is to position myself to be able to play a role in solving the issues faced by the global community today and tomorrow. Namely to be instrumental in the decision making for policies that will effect future generations of humanity, pertaining to society, the environment, economics, politics, research, the list goes on. I endeavour to achieve this by joining a think tank. To manage this I have resolved to attain an education that will stand out in its singular and innovative approach to learning. Quest University will equip me with the versatile skills needed to bring a new perspective to the table.This is how I arrived at this Goal:I have a fascination for the disciplines of history and philosophy and how both can be applied to the present to reconcile differences and even solve world issues. I believe history and philosophy are two halves of a whole; - one, the history of human deeds and the other, the story of the human mind. Together, I think they can give us a deep insight into the decisions and actions of people today from the individual to the globe. Contemplating this has given me the idea of utilising the problem solving potential of these two disciplines to benefit the global community.Further, my more holistic education within a Krishnamurti school has equipped me with a critical mind and a sense of community that has given me a keen interest in different ways of living, particularly closer to nature as can be found at perma-culture communities. This and my interest in Philosophy and History has developed in me a deep passion for how we can change our actions and our thinking to live in a more conscious manner.“Igor is always rigorous in his approach to his work as well as insightful with the kinds of questions he brought to the class. These were posed both in a critical spirit and with a keen desire to enhance his understanding of history and politics, which enabled him to gain a strong understanding of geopolitics and of the motives and politics underpinning the writing of history itself. Igor’s keen ability to analyse texts and grapple with complex thoughts or ideologies is clearly something that he enjoys and I would thoroughly encourage he continue following this passion.”Pierre Smith Khanna, tutor at Brockwood Park International SchoolAn unconventional education:The current world education system has been established to serve the needs of the industrial era which aimed to create a consumer society. Following this in the era of acquiring information and knowledge, we became spectators. Today we are in an era of innovation which is in urgent need of creative thinkers, using one’s imaginative resources to come up with new solutions for a rapidly changing global platform. I believe that an entirely different kind of learning, from primary to tertiary, is required for humanity to open our hearts and minds to a new and less destructive paradigm. An education which in essence encourages a more creative, exploratory, out of the box way of thinking.My journey towards such a different education began in 2014 when I moved from my state school to Brockwood Park International School.This occurred because of my frustration towards the standard education system that began in my final year at the state school. As we entered our GSCE's, education became merely a matter of achieving the best grades with a strong emphasis on conformity where independent thinking is discouraged. It left no room for engaging in discussion or any form of a deeper, more meaningful learning process. I recognised that something had gone wrong, I felt that the innate desire humans have to learn was being stifled. Both me and my parents began to look for an alternative learning environment which provides an openness and freedom for learning through discovery and self inquiry. A place where sharing is encouraged and nurtured, allowing the students to shape their learning in their own hands. While at Brockwood Park school, my learning changed from knowledge imparted one way, something pre-defined and easily evaluated, to a lively ongoing discourse where the emphasis is on analysis, exploration and above all creative thinking-Brockwood@youtube .Brockwood taught me that it is better to look for places in the world which are different, because it is these places that typically have the most vitality, good intention and vision for a better future.And so I discovered Quest university in Canada for the next step in my education. A glimpse into Quest.Quest has led a groundbreaking new approach to higher education. Following a “block plan” which (through intense 3.5 week courses) takes the student across the entirety of human knowledge Academics at Quest, the student must then arrive at a personal question, rather than choosing a conventional major. Before undertaking a Keystone project that will cap each students individualised journey and graduate them from a unique interdisciplinary degree in Arts and Sciences.I believe that the location of Quest, its creatively minded people and its unique curriculum provides an environment conducive to a more organic and open way of learning. Instead of forcing the student to specialise, effectively cutting him or her off from the wealth of new discoveries there are to learn from in the world, Quest first provides students with a wide variety of disciplines to integrate into their learning process, and then allows them to naturally discover their own path of interests, their own voice. Quest allows the tree to grow its own way and celebrates its shape, instead of pruning it. In so doing the student feels inspired to explore the very nature of this process of endless learning with life as his/her teacher. A different education So I look forward that Quest will continue to teach me and help me teach myself to live and learn in a way that will benefit myself, other people and the world. Experiencing the world: Since finishing my secondary education in June 2018 I took it upon myself to take a year away from studies before commencing my university education. This idea was a result of my own initiative to gain some space from institutionalised learning and literally throw myself into the wide world out there all on my own, to discover not only my own abilities and weaknesses, but to learn first hand about other cultures and thus broaden my experiential understanding and insight of the complexity between human endeavour, nature and society. To learn who I am sharing the world with. I first worked in my hometown and used these savings to aid in joining two expeditions, one to Costa Rica and the other to Nepal. Both were part of the World Expeditions initiative. This is an international wilderness guiding company focused on providing ground breaking treks to areas off the tourist trail while lowering the environmental impact and providing an unfiltered experience of the place. For example organising stays with local families. Between the two there was a mixture of trekking, cycling, white-water rafting and mountaineering. These expeditions opened my eyes to wild splendour as I have never seen before, and to a new kind of tourism, where the visitor is taught respect for the place. They opened my heart and mind to the culture, society, beliefs, thoughts and hopes of these places. Furthermore in their physical rigour they pushed the boundaries of what I thought mentally and physically possible for myself.Costa Rica:Here I went far off the tourist trail, gaining an unfiltered experience of the society and the environment including its social and ecological problems. I cycled through primary forests, but also coffee fields and palm oil plantations. I stayed in eco lodges which aim to reduce the impact of a residence but also with local families. Seeing their circumstance and their relationship with the nature around them I gained respect for a people and culture unlike my own.Nepal:Having no experience in high altitude climbing I summited Island Peak 6,189m in the Nepalese Himalayas. It was the most difficult endeavour I have undertaken, challenging me both mentally and physically. In climbing I knew I was pushing my body beyond what I perceived myself able to do, so I knew I was potentially putting myself in harms way. Doing this I learned what I am capable of, that I am able to commit fully to overcome a challenge and that I am able to take real risks without backing down. I left with greater strength of mind and body than I possessed before and new boundaries as to what I am capable of.  Australia:In January I left for Australia, embarking first on a road trip that took me across the entirety of the continent from Perth in the West to Melbourne in the East. After, I settled in Melbourne and made my own way, finding work and saving up. This was the first time living  completely independently without support. This experience has proven invigorating, teaching me to be flexible through changing circumstances and adapt accordingly, particularly relying on myself entirely to overcome challenges. To practice resolving conflict with empathy and observation.Mexico:To finish my year away from home I am now helping a friend with an independent wilderness guiding business he has started in Mexico in the state of Chihuahua, guiding in the Copper canyon. Both me and him are interested in sustainable and regenerative Eco-friendly tourism and he has actively begun to implement environmental awareness into his company. Regenerative tourism is the practice of not only preserving the natural surroundings but giving back to it. Two examples the company is engaging in is the planting of trees and the installation of hidden wildlife cameras to gain evidence of endangered species in certain areas and then actively campaigning to have those areas protected. The company is called Oso Negro  (black bear) after an endangered species of bear that inhabits that part of the Copper Canyon. The company is certified with 'Leave no Trace' and is aiming to be certified with the Rainforest Alliance, both are Eco-tourism initiatives. Oso Negro employs the indigenous people of the area, such as the Raramuri people, as guides because they know the region very well. Doing so imbues them with a sense of pride and respect for their homeland and heritage, which is eroding because of their need to move to the towns and cities to make a living for their families. Their ancestral knowledge and respect will be passed on to the visitors and provide them with a deeper and richer experience of the country and its people. I aim to take part in Oso Negros venture, helping my friend sustain this company and promote its values by working as a guide with him and his colleagues. This is the kind of real life change I am interested in being a part of now and in the future, a positive change for the people and the nature of our planet. I am super excited to have the opportunity to be a part of this!I am aiming to raise the funds for Quest university by the deadline to submit 10th of August 2019.I would be very grateful if you would share this request with anyone who  would be willing to contribute. Thank you.","December 28, 2018",£130,"£9,500 "

As the retaliation, RailCorp managers plotted to kill me, vilified me with Psychological Health Problem, threatened me to suicide, and illegal dismissed me on 19 Nov 2009.

Since Australian government decided on 18 Dec 2017 to replace Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Mr Alexander Downer, three deadly train incidents involving Amtrak passenger trains in USA in less than two months. Amtrak is the name of the company that runs most passenger trains in the USA, with some government funding.USA Amtrak deadly train incident 1The day after Australian government decided on 18 Dec 2017 (USA time 17 Dec 2017) to replace Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Mr Alexander Downer. <George Brandis is off to London, sparking pre-Christmas Cabinet reshuffle>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-18/george-brandis-to-take-over-as-australias-uk-high-commissioner/9267482On 19 Dec 2017 (USA time 18 Dec 2017), an US Amtrak passenger train that derailed, killed three people and about 100 people were injured, was travelling at 80mph (130km/h, more than twice the speed limit) on a curve with a speed limit of 30mph.<Amtrak Washington train crash: Investigators focus on speed>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42408624USA Amtrak deadly train incident 2Two days after USA House Republicans voted to release secret Nunes memo on Russia probe on 30 Jan 2018 (USA time 29 Jan 2018). <House Republicans vote to release secret memo on Russia probe>http://www.smh.com.au/world/house-republicans-vote-to-release-secret-memo-on-russia-probe-20180130-p4yz1k.htmlOn 1 Feb 2018 (USA time 31 Jan 2018), an Amtrak train carrying Republican lawmakers to their annual policy retreat crashed into a large garbage truck at a crossing in rural Virginia, killing one of the garbage truck’s passengers and injured six people.<Train Carrying Republican Lawmakers to Retreat Crashes Into Truck>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/us/gop-retreat-train-crash.htmlUSA Amtrak deadly train incident 3Two days after President Donald Trump approved the release of secret Nunes memo on Russia probe on 3 Feb 2018 (USA time 2 Feb 2018). <Disputed GOP-Nunes memo released with Trump's approval>https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/02/politics/republican-intelligence-memo/index.htmlOn 5 Feb 2018 (USA time 4 Feb 2018), an Amtrak passenger train collided with the CSX freight train parked on a side track in South Carolina, United States. That two people (Amtrak engineer Mr Michael Kempf and Amtrak conductor Mr Michael Cella) were killed, 116 people injured, and some 19,000 litres of fuel leaked.<Federal officials focus on why railroad switch was set in the wrong position in S.C.

The Amtrak-CSX train collision in USA on 4 Feb 2018 could be avoided, if the Americans had learned the lessons from what the Rail ""Religion"" have secretly plotted in RailCorp (New South Wales state rail, Australia) since 2005. Lesson 1) The rail signalling system was not operating, indeed led to train collision.Lesson 2) Mis-leading train to drive into the wrong train line, indeed led to train collision.Lesson 3) The active Train Location System is a very import software tool to avoid train collision.This Amtrak-CSX train collision in USA on 4 Feb 2018 based on the simplest case - Track occupied by a train in front. ""The Amtrak train, traveling on tracks owned and maintained by freight railway giant, CSX, was supposed to pass over the switch to continue on to the main line tracks, but instead was directed onto the pad-locked (ie. Setting the railroad switch in the wrong position, had been done manually) crossing into a portion of track known as “siding” which was occupied by a parked CSX train,A railroad switch was set in the wrong position ... and signal outage, sending an Amtrak train... off the main line and onto a side track.... maintenance work was being performed on the signal system prior to Sunday’s crash.... the signalling system was not operating, which is why trains were being directed through the corridor manually by CSX dispatchers.”<Federal officials focus on why railroad switch was set in the wrong position in S.C. Amtrak crash that killed 2>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2018/02/04/at-least-2-dead-after-amtrak-train-collides-with-freight-train-in-south-carolina/?utm_term=.9d642a6f4decLesson 1) The rail signalling system was not operating, indeed led to train collision. The incident ""Sydney train chaos on 12 Apr 2011"", internally incurred by the rail signalling control systems ATRICS located in Sydenham Signal Box, and lasted more than nine hours. RailCorp said about 100,000 people were affected by the outage, which hit the Bankstown, Inner West, South, South Coast, Airport and East Hills and Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra lines.<Hardware failure triggers Sydney train chaos> about what happened on NSW train service on 12 Apr 2011. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/hardware-failure-triggers-sydney-train-chaos-20110412-1dbhk.htmlFortunately, RailCorp Train Operators in Sydenham Signal Box, did not dispatch any train while the rail signalling control systems ATRICS crashed down on 12 Apr 2011. NO train collision.Lesson 2) Mis-leading train to drive into the wrong train line, indeed led to train collision. Diverting a passenger train from a mainline to the siding is unusual, especially no report of anything really gone wrong on the Amtrak passenger Train 91 on 4 Feb 2018.Please refer to attached email <ARS set train path for the removed trip 22Jul2005>, about the detail technical investigation and the procedures to reproduce the defect (Defect ID: PR4401) in RailCorp operational rail signalling control systems ATRICS.That defect (Defect ID: PR4401) made the rail signals to mis-signal the train driving into the wrong train line, which consequence is - Train passengers had been carried to the wrong destinations by no choice, and also it could cause train collision. Since I detected and logged the defect (Defect ID: PR4401) in the software module ""Automatic Route Setting"" (ARS) of the rail signalling control systems ATRICS on 27 July 2005, Mr Rezaul Pial Imam had been promoted by RailCorp management (Mr Karu PALLEGEDERA and Mr Stephen Templeton) and paid more to intentionally harass me at the same female toilet in RailCorp office Building (Ground Floor, Unit 5, 1XX Arthur Street, Homebush West, NSW).Please refer to attached email <Two males entered or used same female toilet three times at RailCorp office Building 2Feb2007>.Mr Stephen Templeton lied in his email (Dated 2 February 2007) attached, that the males had been given the permission to use female toilet in RailCorp office buildings (Unit 5 & 6, 1XX Arthur Street, Homebush West, NSW). Where is such permission written down? That breached the New South Wales WorkCover <Workplace amenities: Code of practice>. 1)  Separate toilets should be provided for male and female employees.2)  The number of toilets required for Males employees are, 1 Closet Pan(s) per 20 males and 1 Urinals per 25 males.On 20 Sep 2005, the deletion of the defect report of the serious software defect (Defect ID: PR4401) from RailCorp Change Management System, that cover up could bury this deliberate software defect (Defect ID: PR4401) in the operational rail signalling control systems ATRICS to incur the rail incident any time. Lesson 3) The active Train Location System is a very import software tool to avoid train collision. Was the CSX active Train Location System operating on 4 Feb 2018, while the CSX rail signalling system was not operating on 4 Feb 2018? If NO, then the CSX dispatch center supposed to stop dispatching any train to avoid train collision.If YES, then the CSX dispatchers should be able to see both locations where the CSX freight train parked and where the Amtrak passenger Train 91 was driving within the CSX rail network. Did the CSX dispatchers order the Amtrak passenger Train 91 to stop, as soon as the Amtrak passenger Train 91 was driving into the wrong train line?The four-fold RailCorp IT&T disasters one after another on 7-8 Aug 2008 overnight, brought down RailCorp active Train Location System in 3 different ways, to stop the NSW train service and/or even cause train collision (Similar strategy to the 9.11 incident in USA in 2001, four passenger-airplanes crashed to 3 different ground targets). I successfully managed the RailCorp IT&T Disaster Recovery before 4AM on 8 Aug 2008.The attached logs <RailCorp SPI Help Desk Logs 8Aug2008>, was the written evidence of all operational Passenger Information System (SPI) servers lost the connections to OSS after 1:30am on 8 Aug 2008.It’s at the last minute RailCorp management rostered me to work at Strathfield Signal Box tonight (7-8 Aug 2008), instead of the standard 72 hours notice at least, for scheduled network upgrade and relocation (for the brand new Epping-Chatswood-Rail-Link) but not for emergency. Hence, the Rail ""Religion"" failed to use the train collision to kill anyone in NSW on 8 Aug 2008. As the retaliation, they plotted to kill me - On 2 Oct 2008, Mr Ricardo Silva (RailCorp ATRICS Maintenance and Support Team Manager) directed the Receptionist Ms Muy Pheng LY used a heavy full water tank (12-15kg) to strike the cupboard door (usually key-locked up by office Admin) on the back of my head hardly at RailCorp kitchen.Please refer to the photos in Page 3 of attached <RailCorp Level 5 Investigation Report Homebush West 2Oct08>, which report fabricated by Mr Sidney Jackson the non-Safety-Investigator and illegal-author (no legal delegation from my Line Manager Mr Vince Lofaro) with twisted facts and false conditions. WHY Mr Ricardo Silva (Portuguese born and grew up in Macau China)? In the cold early morning on 29 May 2008, Mr Ricardo Silva suspiciously entered the Strathfield Signal Box without Site Notification - a serious breach of RailCorp major Signal Box security, which breach detected by Mr Vince Lofaro at about 2:30 AM during we were upgrading and relocating the network equipment at Strathfield Signal Box (Same project finished two months later when RailCorp IT&T Disaster Recovery before 4AM on 8 Aug 2008). Despite Mr Silva was responsible to send out all Site Notifications for all work to be done by the Signalling Control Systems Section, and an ATRICS Support Engineer (Alan? assigned by Mr Ricardo Silva) was already on-duty on the same overnight shift (28-29 May 2008) as us (Alex Maioroff, Clement Wong, Richard Mitchell, Vince Lofaro, Tony Henry, and myself) at Strathfield Signal Box.This serious security breach witnessed by 7 professionals in the ATRICS room at Strathfield Signal Box on 29 May 2008.(ATRICS Support Engineer Alan?

Lauren Ashlee Evans ,"Spring, TX","Medical, Illness & Healing","Thank you for taking the time to check out my campaign. Some of you might personally know me..for those who don't, my name is Lauren Evans and I'm seeking help due to mounting medical bills from contracting a parasite (Giardia) on vacation. How it all started:As some of you are aware, July 3rd-10th I was in Canada. I expected to see the beauty of Jasper and Banff National Park as part of a nice little get away I had been saving up for for some time. What I was not expecting was to bring something back with me.The second day into the vacation I started feeling terribly ill. I was attempting to stay level headed about it..blaming it on potential altitude sickness or motion sickness due to lots of driving in a rental car. The days following were really quite a blur. I was trying to push through, despite feeling the worst I've ever felt in my life, since I was in a different country. By the grace of God I somehow managed to make it back to the states without having any sort of medical attention whilst in Canada. (That was EASILY the HARDEST plane ride of my LIFE). What happened following my return home:I was now a full week into feeling like death by the time I got home and there was still no sign of my body being on the mend. I went into this vacation weighing 121lbs and came back a whopping 111lbs. I wasn't sure what was going on, but it was nothing like I had ever experienced (and I've definitely had my fair share of the flu and the occasional stomach bug). I was so nauseous I couldn't eat (I didn't eat for three straight days while away), and, if I did attempt to eat, it wasn't staying down for very long. I felt like I was a hostage in my own body. Since I had just had the previous week off from work, I decided I was going to attempt to work for a few days before seeing a doctor. I figured they would take me more seriously if I went in on day 10 still not feeling well. ER Visit #1:I somehow managed two days of work before I rushed myself to the emergency room. I thought they would surely help me figure out what was going on. I was extremely dehydrated by this point so, of course, they hooked me up to an IV (helpful). I told the doctor the rundown of my symptoms and mentioned I really believed I had contracted a parasite. He basically brushed everything I said aside and wrote me a script for some nausea medication and told me to buy some Imodium (not helpful in the slightest). I went back home and finally broke down. I felt incredibly defeated and I felt like because I don't have medical insurance he was being the LEAST helpful. (I don't qualify for Obamacare or medicaid--trust me, I would LOVE to have insurance). I knew that doctor bill was going to be incredibly expensive. And I knew I was probably going to end back up in the ER again. I literally had no relief. And to top it all off, I still felt dehydrated leaving that first ER visit. ER Visit #2: Fast forward two more days and I had dropped another 3lbs. I was about halfway through my work day and I collapsed in the break room. At this point, I hadn't had anything substantial to eat in 12 days (I was basically eating a few almonds and a handful of berries in an entire day), I was drinking as much water as possible, but I had no relief. I was still incredibly dehydrated. As soon as I could stand back on my feet, I left the salon and drove myself to yet another ER. I cried and prayed the whole way there for some answers and relief. An IV, a dozen lab tests, and a CT scan later, it was determined I did, in fact, have a parasite in my body (if anyone knows me, you know this is my literal worst nightmare). I was informed that if I had waited much longer I could have gone into renal failure, and if that had happened, my other organs would have shortly followed. (Yes, my anxiety was through the roof). Finally a diagnosis and treatment:They wrote me a script for a heavy duty anti-parasitic medication. I was then informed that they try to avoid prescribing this drug due to its strength and that I was going to feel like I was going through chemo. I would have most, if not all of the same symptoms. They also mentioned I was definitely going to feel worse while on this drug, and I might have to come back into the ER. (Perfect). And then, the best news yet: the medication probably wouldn't kill all of it. It would kill enough of it to where it wasn't going to kill me, but I would need to make a lifestyle change to stay in control of my own body. In order to flush it from my system I need to avoid caffeine, alcohol, dairy, sugar (including fruit), and all carbs (both flour and wheat) for the next 8 months-1 year. And I was to eat everything as fresh and organic as possible. (So....what CAN I eat exactly?!) ER Visit #3:I started the medication immediately. Three times a day for ten days. Five days into it, I was feeling so horrible I started panicking in the middle of the night. I sent a text out to a friend who is a pharmacist and a client who is a nurse just to try to get an outside opinion (I REALLY didn't want to have to go into the ER a third time if I didn't have to). Both told me I needed to get to a hospital ASAP. (Shoutout to Jeff and Kerrie for being amazing and responding promptly). Round three. More tests, another IV (I was STILL dehydrated), and some pain medication. I still felt terrible..but slightly more stable, at the very least.I was told to keep taking the medication. It was so rough I was sleeping about 18 hours/day the entire time I was on it. I couldn't even walk to the bathroom..much less try to work or even function like a normal human being. At one point I literally thought I wasn't going to make it to see another morning. I have no idea how I managed to take all 30 pills, but I somehow did. Two days after I stopped the medication, I started to feel like I was human again (although, I still was so weak I couldn't stand for long). Altogether, I was horribly sick for 21 days. I went 33 days before I had another meal to where I felt full and satisfied. I've never gone so long with eating so little. It was easily the most terrifying experience of my life. Honestly, I wasn't sure if I would even be here to type any of this up. I've never been much of a morning person, but I can truly say that I feel infinitely blessed every morning my feet hit the floor and I stand up from bed. I never knew how spiritual and emotional that every day ritual would become for me. I'm trying to remain as positive as I can and take each day as they come. I'm finally learning to cook, and I'm having to get really creative with veggies and protein. (Lol) The reason I started this campaign:All the lighthearted jokes aside, My fight isn't over. It's just beginning. I still have more doctors and specialists I must see and stay in contact with throughout this next year to make sure I stay on top of this. I've paid off my first ER visit already (along with all of the medications and supplements I've had to buy--almost $2,000 total in a span of 2 weeks. This was everything I had left in my savings). With the other two ER visits, I owe a substantial amount. I'm going to be honest..I am TERRIBLE with asking for help. Especially when it comes to money. If I thought I could handle this burden on my own, I would. But the bills keep rolling in. To date I have received bills totaling $23,986.73 with a substantial amount of additional medical expenses to follow. For those of you who feel it on your heart to contribute monetarily or share this campaign, I cannot thank you enough. Your support is greatly appreciated!! PSA: This parasite (Giardia) can be found in all 50 states and around the world. It can be found in fresh water, whether it's hot or cold. It can enter your body through the soles of your feet or via ingestion. I highly recommend never going without shoes in any fresh body of water (including natural hot springs).  Not all cases are as severe as mine, but I wanted to shed light on the situation and possibly prevent someone else from experiencing what I'm going through. Giardia is difficult to diagnose. Because of this, it delayed me receiving the treatment necessary to fight it in a timely manner.  Unfortunately, the longer you go before a diagnosis, the more harm it causes your body. It can actually prevent significant absorption of nutrients in your small intestine. It can lead to lasting damage that you can struggle with for years, and it is extremely hard to expel from your body.  I am doing everything I possibly can to be proactive in this fight, including the extreme dietary measures. ","August 6, 2017","$3,780","$24,000 "
Rebeca Gutierrez ,"Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom",Education & Learning,"Hi everyone!Thanks for stopping by my gofundme page! For those of you who don’t know me, I recently got accepted to study at the International Center of Photography in New York on their General Studies one-year program. The school focuses on encouraging their students to make ‘concerned photography’, meaning they believe in the power of images in socio and political contexts to educate and change the world. I feel truly honoured that they saw the power in my work to do this. I have been awarded two scholarships from the Director of the School and Galina Fetcher, that cover $15k of the total tuition. I’m a photographic artist working within the realm of environmental issues with a particular interest for the Anthropocene, making images that draw attention to the fragile state of our planet through abstract and unique photograms. The Anthropocene is our most recent geological time period where our ecosystems are being significantly altered by human activity. The role of my most important body of work, Polyethylene Alchemy, has been to draw attention to our extensive reliance of single-use plastic by making photograms with these materials, depicting the landscape that the plastics themselves are now destroying. The production of plastic is a contributory factor of climate change, and my intention with my work is, through raising awareness of the issues, to play a part in halting the destruction of our planet. By attending ICP, I will be able to delve deeper into understanding the role of photography as a catalyst for change. From the beginning of my bachelor’s degree I was drawn to the early creation of photography, and the literal idea of drawing with light. I started to learn about alternative processes in the medium, and quickly became very engaged with making photograms. This can be described as the process of making an image without the use of a camera, by placing objects directly onto photographic paper and then exposing it to a light. My work in this field garnered me a First Class Honours Degree in Photography from the University of Brighton, UK, and has been been subsequently exhibited and published internationally. As well as plastic pollution, my work also touches on chemical water pollution and contamination. I chose to work with photograms as I am fascinated with the idea of having the environment that I am studying be physically transcribed onto my photographic materials. When making the photograms in Watermarks, I worked within the landscape itself, allowing the moonlight as my only light source to travel through seemingly-pure seawater and river water, and be recorded on the light-sensitive paper submerged. I traced the invisible lines of the waters that I once thought of as being so pure, but the final images revealed coloured chemical traces and stains on my black and white photographic paper indicating the level of contamination in the water. For Transatlantic, I participated in an artist residency for Port Franc with German sailing company Timbercoast, on their first round trip transporting merchandise from Canada to France, where I made photograms in a self-made darkroom in the cargo of the ship, raising awareness about cargo shipping marine pollution, as we demonstrated it is possible to transport cargo by sail.My photograms are unique, one-off images, created after endless hours of work both within the landscape itself, and in the darkroom. The photogram itself is my “negative”, which once developed in the darkroom, can only be reproduced by scanning it digitally.  This fragile and unique way of working parallels the frailty of our ecosystem and natural world. Being in New York and becoming a part of the community of ICP will give me a once in a lifetime opportunity to expand my technical skills and really explore how to present these environmental issues within a photographic fine art context. As part of New York’s artistic community, I will be able to reach a much wider audience and expand the impact of these images.  I am reaching out to you to help me fundraise to cover the rest of my costs for tuition and materials.

Eric William Jones ,"Blue Lake, CA","Creative Arts, Music & Film","""Twenty strangers are trapped in a room, filled with signs that they have been locked there for ages. Nobody remembers how or why they came to be there. A digital timer above the door begins to count down from 30 minutes. What happens when the clock hits zero? As the prisoners begin to explore their surroundings, they uncover that not only are they trapped in that room - they are trapped in time, forced to relive their shameful pasts only to have their minds wiped clean when the timer hits zero. Will this time around be different? Will they overcome the insurmountable odds in order to escape, or will they be locked in this time loop forever?""Have you ever wanted to try an escape room or take part in a murder mystery dinner party? Or do you like roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons or Vampire: The Masquerade? LetMeOut is a new form of performance where theatre and role-playing games collide to forge a fully-immersive audience experience. By using interactive entertainment and role playing game mechanics in a theatrical setting, this new form of performance will tear down the fourth wall, opening up a limitless, imaginative playground. LetMeOut will invite audience members to leave the real world behind and step into a new reality, shaping the course of events. There will be no defining line between ""audience"" and ""performers"" - everyone has a role to play.Who Are We?We are an international ensemble of physical theatre artists, dedicated to exploring new frontiers of live performance - namely, through audience immersive theatre. Eric William Jones, Marguerite Boissonnault, and Linnéa Ytterlid all studied together at Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre in Blue Lake, California from 2015-2016, and are reuniting to create LetMeOut as part of the Dell'Arte International Thesis Festival in May of 2018. Eric William Jones is an interdisciplinary artist and performer from Waukesha, WI. He received a BA in Theatre Direction from Macalester College, and has performed with companies throughout the US, Canada and Italy. He is captivated by the exploration of the intersection between role-playing games and theatre of audience immersion. LetMeOut will serve as his thesis project for a master of fine arts degree in ensemble based physical theatre at Dell’Arte International School of Physical Theatre. Marguerite Boissonnault is a writer, theater maker, performer, and educator from Park City, Utah. With her first degree in Broadcast Journalism from Humboldt State University, she is a published theater reviewer and freelance writer. She currently teaches youth theater with the Egyptian Theater back in her hometown of Park City, and continues her training as an aerialist in the circus arts.Linnéa Ytterlid is an actress, dancer, and director from Sweden. She studied dance at Balettakademien in Stockholm and theatre at Kulturama and Dell’Arte International School of Physical Theatre. Currently, she’s working on a project to spread awareness about mental health, rehearsing a mask performance in a family show, and dancing modern and Arabic dance with a dance company consisting of refugees.What Do We Need?LetMeOut is the culmination of over a year of research and development spanning two continents and countless hours of Skype calls. We believe that our new method of performance has the potential to be revolutionary, and that this project will serve as the catalyst for a lifetime of work in an exciting new field of live performance. Instead of being a one-and-done type of show, LetMeOut will become the template for future audience immersive theatre around the world. But we need your help!In order to create this project, we have several goals to meet in our fundraising efforts. With your help, we will allocate donations to the following areas, in this order:1. Travel - $850Both Marguerite and Linnea are visiting artists, and with these fundraising efforts, we hope to cover the costs of their travel.2. Housing - $1800This amount will cover the costs for renting inexpensive apartment rooms for Marguerite and Linnea for the two month creation process.3. Living Expenses - $1800While this is a passion-project, we don't want to be literal starving artists!4. Production Costs/Stipend for Visiting Artists - $400Because we will be thinking ""outside the box"" in terms of our production, we also hope to raise some additional funds to create the aesthetic space we believe will suit our artistic needs. In addition, we are staunch believers that if at all possible, artists should receive some stipend for their work. LetMeOut will be performed as part of the MFA student Dell'Arte International Thesis Festival, and all tickets are pay-what-you-can. The proceeds from ticket sales go directly into funding more Dell'Arte student productions like this!Thank you so much for your interest in making LetMeOut a success and for being a part of our fundraising efforts! With Fervor and Imagination,Eric William JonesMarguerite BoissonnaultLinnéa Ytterlid","January 8, 2018","$1,795","$4,850 "

On May 26, the CPC is hosting its annual convention in Vancouver, B.C. After a over decade of Stephen Harper's strong leadership, our party is preparing for its first leadership race in over 12 years.  We feel its important for the next generation of Conservatives to attend, and we hope you agree. However, attending the conference is very expensive. 
 
Along with the significant conference fee itself, a round trip costs from Montreal costs over $700, along with another $150 for an Airbnb. For full-time students, of all parties, conferences likes these are very difficult to afford. We're passionate about Canada's conservative movement and eager to share our ideas for the party's future, but we can't afford to spare two months rent and groceries.

Concerned Ontarians ,"Toronto, ON",Other,"Support this campaign to #stickittodougford and show the Conservative government that we will not stand for seeing our tax dollars wasted on politically-motivated, anti-environmental propaganda.The Ontario Conservative government under Doug Ford has created the following anti-carbon tax sticker, and plan to enforce gas stations in the province to display them under penalty of fines of up to $10,000.Not only is this sticker grossly misleading about the financial costs that the average Ontarian will experience as a result of carbon pricing (70%-80% of households stand to experience financial gain as a result of the carbon rebate), it is a move that seeks to undermine legislation dedicated to taking action against the increasing threat of climate change.To combat this move, we have created two additional stickers that seek to counter the Ford administration's misleading narrative and provide Ontarians with more accurate information about Carbon Pricing in Canada. This campaign is not intended to be an endorsement of the Liberal Party of Canada (every Federal party but the Conservatives supports the introduction of carbon pricing). This is a criticism of the Ford government for enforcing a campaign of misinformation for political gain, and a failure to take action on climate change.The Ford government estimates spending at least $5,000 of tax payers money  printing 25,000 of these stickers. This fundraiser seeks to match that amount, in order to nullify the impact of their campaign. #stickittodougford and show the Conservative government that Ontarians will not stand for this, and are not afraid to combat Ford's misleading and harmful narratives. FundraisingFunds raised will go to the cost of printing environmentally-friendly stickers and distributing them to businesses and any interested individuals.

Harleen Aujla ,"Vancouver, BC",Other,"***HELP FUNDRAISE FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS***Here's our backstory:Women’s suffrage (or franchise) is the right of women to vote in political elections; campaigns for this right generally included demand for the right to run for public office. The women’s suffrage movement was a decades-long struggle intended to address fundamental issues of equity and justice and to improve the lives of Canadians. Women in Canada met strong resistance as they struggled for basic human rights, including suffrage. Representative of more than justice in politics, suffrage represented hopes for improvements in education, healthcare and employment as well as an end to violence against women and children. By the mid-19th century, full citizenship was legally limited to men; by the end of the century, laws across the country mandated near-universal, White male citizenship at the federal and provincial level and explicitly excluded female voters. Around that time, many women began to agitate for the vote as well as for social reform. Suffragists — people who advocated for the extension of suffrage — were typically White, middle-class women, many of whom believed that suffrage would increase the influence of their class and result in a better country. Women’s suffrage was also supported by Black abolitionists (such as Mary Ann Shadd), as well as unionists, socialists and temperance activists. The majority of Canadian suffragists relied on peaceful campaigning. Only a handful identified with the militant suffragettes led by Emmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928) and the Women’s Social and Political Union in the United Kingdom.  Achieving the Vote in Federal Elections:During the First World War, pressure mounted on federal politicians in the Conservative — later the Union Government (1917) — of Sir Robert Borden. The government wished both to acknowledge women’s contribution to the war effort and to appeal to future female voters by extending the franchise; it also wanted to firm up support for conscription. The government also feared that voters who were born in countries with which Canada was at war would oppose conscription, especially men born in those countries. In the controversial Military Voters Act and Wartime Elections Act of 1917, the federal vote was extended to nursing sisters (women serving in the Canadian Army Medical Corps) and to close female relatives of military men. At the same time, the Wartime Elections Act disenfranchised thousands of immigrants from enemy countries who had become citizens after 1902 as well as all conscientious objectors (those who refused to go to war because it was against their religious, moral or ethical beliefs). The Act divided Canadian suffragists, many of whom opposed partial enfranchisement and disenfranchisement.  Once conscription was secured, the government began to argue that women had earned the right to vote through their war work. On 24 May 1918, female citizens, not included under racial or Indigenous exclusions, aged 21 and over became eligible to vote in federal elections regardless of whether they had yet attained the provincial franchise. In July 1919, enfranchised women gained the right to stand for the House of Commons, although appointment to the Senate remained out of reach until after the Persons Case of 1929. The Dominion Elections Act of 1920 continued to exclude as voters anyone disenfranchised because of race in the provinces (this meant Japanese, Chinese and South Asians in BC and the Chinese in Saskatchewan) and maintained exclusions of Inuit and most First Nations.  Women in Politics:Once women won the vote, they encountered considerable resistance in entering politics. In 1921, Agnes Macphail became the first woman to win a seat in the House of Commons, representing the United Farmers of Ontario; the next, Martha Black replaced her ailing husband in 1935 as Conservative MP for Yukon; the third, Saskatchewan’s Dorise Nielsen (associated with the CCF and then the Communist Party of Canada), arrived in Ottawa in 1940 but found little support. The first Indigenous female Member of Parliament was the Liberal Ethel Blondin Andrews for Western Arctic, Northwest Territories, in 1988.  This article is for a school project, please do not donate to this.

Cody Payant ,"Saskatoon, SK",Other,"Dear friends from Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek ,This summer, we continue the most important race of our life. I've not been provided a script for this address. As a matter of fact I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few months.I have spent most of my life politically within the Conservative Party. I recently have seen fit to chart another course. In October, our country will need every ounce of its energy to restore itself. As we know, the costs of government are all assessed upon the people. This means that the farmer is doomed to provide a certain amount of money, out of the sale of his produce, no matter how low the price, to pay their taxes. The manufacturer, the professional man or woman, the clerk, must do the same with their income.The expenses of the government reach everybody. Taxes take from everyone a part of their earnings and force everyone to work for a certain part of their time for the government. The annual spending of our government has exceeded 420 billion dollars, while our nation's federal debt has surpassed 680 billion. These are some of the reasons why I want to cut down public expense. I want the people of Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek to work less for the federal government, and more for themselves. I want them to have the rewards of their own industry. This is the chief meaning of freedom.Until we can reestablish a condition under which the earnings of the people can be kept by the people, we are bound to suffer a very severe and distinct curtailment of our liberty.The interventionist course of both the Liberal and Conservative governments are well documented. From the Conservative governments of Brian Mulroney and Stephen Harper, which added over 400 billion dollars to our nation's federal debt, to the industry crippling socialist economic policies of Pierre Trudeau and his son, these results are not fanciful, they are not imaginary, they are grimly actual and real, reaching in to every household in the land.Currently they take from each family home an average of over 37,000 dollars annually, and taxes must be paid, they are not a voluntary contribution. One of the greatest favors that can be bestowed upon the Canadian people is economy in government. One of the greatest burdens: too much government in the economy.I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by our forefathers in the true north strong and free. And as we are reminded that we don't know how lucky we are to live in Canada, it is perhaps more important to remember the immigrant who reminds us of how lucky they are that they had some place to escape to. If we lose freedom in the west, there is no place left to escape to.And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This too, is a key issue in this election, whether we believe in our capacity as Canadians for self government or whether we abandon Canadian confederation and confess that the unelected councils of the United Nations can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.It is for these reasons that I am unable to in good conscience remain on the sidelines. It is for these reasons that I joined Maxime Bernier and the People's Party of Canada in the first place in August, 2018, and it is for these reasons, that I am now announcing my candidacy as your official PPC candidate for our riding of Carlton Trail - Eagle Creek.Freedom, Fairness, Responsibility and Respect. These are the words we have heard often over the past ten months, and these are the words we will continue to hear as we work for Canadians to restore peace, order and good governance to the House of Commons. Send me to Ottawa my friends and I promise you, you will not be disappointed.Thank you and God bless.","July 18, 2019",0,"$5,000 goal"

Lynn Johnson ,"Oxbow, SK","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","""A PLACE FOR ALL"" and an  ""AMAZING PLACE"" it will be!!!This funding site is being updated as of today Wednesday, February 27, 2019 because I wish to broaden the scope of my call for funding. There is a Federal Election this fall in Canada. Due to this if I receive enough in donations to afford to, it is my every intention to run for member of parliament as an independent candidate.I have supported and voted for various parties provincially and federally in the past . All parties have their strong points, all parties have their frailties and short comings.I agree with Trudeau and the Liberals that a strong middle class is key to a strong stable economy, and I also agree that the Harper Conservatives were treacherous and divisive in their negative approach to politics and so I tend not to follow their example much. Rt. Hon. Joe Clark never became a Conservative but chose to remain a Progressive Conservative which I find to be a far more palatable political approach for conservative politics. Maxime Bernier has recently started a Conservative off shoot party called the People's Party which is a resurrection of the Progressive Conservative party. I may decide to align part of my independent platform with that of the People's Party over time as we find out more about them. I do contend that the presence of a progressive conservative party is a good thing to have in Canadian politics again. Welcome back Maxine Bernier et al.I also feel the Green Party has some relevant positions on environmental and social issues which bear consideration when running a country and deciding what's best. Their leader, Elizabeth May sets a very good example of a deliberate attempt in the over all picture of Canadian politics of a cooperative and constructive interaction with other parties and their affairs. She sets a good example of how politicians should attempt to interact on a day to day interparty basis.The NDP under Jack Layton were a party that championed the little guy, and the thought of inclusiveness and acceptance of others. For the most part that is a fairly good position to maintain. The NDP also has it's concerns with social programs and structure.Again they have their good points and their bad but definitely have issues, ideas and perspectives to be considered when running this country.You may want to know what my thoughts are on the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana last Oct. 17, 2018. Let's just say, ""If you can't keep off the grass, just mow the lawn when necessary."" LOLMedical marijuana has it's many merits and benefits and as far as what people choose to do is really their own business as long as there's no harm to others.So I want to run for Parliament this fall, so please help fund my campaign. I ran for Parliament in 1984 when I was 28 years old as a Rt. Hon. John Turner Liberal. He wasn't crazy about free trade and risking becoming an economic trading colony and economic puppet of the USA and neither was I.I was not successful in my efforts and withdrew my candidacy prior to the nomination meeting. This was so I wouldn't split the vote and risk having a more qualified candidate miss out and lose the nomination.It is over 30 years later and I feel qualified for this job now.So please read my entry in it's entirety, donate to my cause and vote for me this fall as an Independent candidate for Parliament. As a independent I can speak my mind, say the things that should be said, and not be muzzled to tow some misguided party line in some cases.So enjoy the rest of my entry. Donate to my campaign and cause, get in touch to volunteer to be part of the campaign team if you like and see you on the campaign trail. If I raise adequate enough funds to finance the campaign in time.Why should you donate? With the economy in our area as slow as it is as a result of the low price of oil if I am elected I'd have a job again and I would have a definite appreciation of it and would serve this constancy well and from a grassroots approach.I intend to represent the constituency of Qu’Appelle-Moose Mountain, with the position of taking what's best from all parties and what makes the most pragmatic sense, as opposed to being stuck with some old outdated party mantra or belief. I will represent the voices and concerns and best interests of my constituency first as apposed to towing some external party line interest. This I can do as an independent M.P.As far as political experience I have some to call on from my past and I've been governor of my own independent state of mind all my life. LolJoin the effort, join the campaign, volunteer if you like. The main priority is that we do some good as a result, enjoy the task at hand and of course have some constructive fun.So read the rest of my entry and find out who you might want to vote for this fall in the Federal election.

This concept had been put together by myself, Lynn Johnson, and a few key blue-chip developers. At the time of conception (the early 80's) Grant Devine was the Premier of the Province of Saskatchewan and his deputy premier was Eric Berntson. He was also the MLA for the Souris-Cannington constituency in the extreme S.E. corner of the province.It was the fifth year of their first term of mandate the P.C. gov't had to call an election in the spring of 1987. Some of these blue chip notables and some key P.C. members were lining up about $225 million in 1987 dollar value behind me to run against Eric Berntson.First, because they felt I had been well connected in my blue-chip careers thus far, that and as well, because they didn't want to vote for Eric Berntson again. Why? Recent to the impending election call Eric Berntson was in the news for alleged improprieties to his adopted teenage daughter. The next thing you know people are wanting me to run against him. But before we could get a campaign under way his adopted daughter gets thrown in a mental hospital and three of Eric Berntson's closest political associates trump up 3 criminal charges on me. As a matter of some incorrect paperwork and a paper-shuffle I was unable to defend myself and have the charges defended in court because before you knew it, I was thrown in a mental hospital too. Several years later I found out from a lawyer that there was a very notable misdelegation of due process that had me thrown in a mental hospital so I couldn't run against Eric Berntson.After his re-election and subsequent promotion to a federal Senator under their Rt.Hon. Brian Mulroney, he eventually had justice catch up with him hence he served time in jail on fraud charges to do with political pay-offs and influence-peddling and the like.Eris Berntson was known to be a crude, vulgar at times, populist bully who never was on the up and up.Back to my charges and the trip to the mental hospital I got railroaded and diagnosed as a schizophrenic by a doctor whose hospital was receiving millions of dollars as a result of Eric Berntson's gov't. Yes I was railroaded by a complicit psychiatrist who was part of Berntson's political takedown of me.I wasn't hearing voices and I hadn't ever been. That's part of a schizophrenic diagnoses. As well as not hearing voices I displayed none of the other characteristics that went along with the complicit and corrupt psychiatrist's diagnoses of me.After I got out of the hospital my phone had stopped ringing for my busy little business. The horrible medications they forced me to take for a gross misdiagnosis were debilitating and mental disorientating.As a result, instead of continuing on with a burgeoning and successful business and political career in my late 20's I got forced onto a disability pension and fell out of touch with my crowd of business associates.So ""Amazing Place"" and all the economic diversity that had been planned for S.E. Sask never happened because the people involved didn't want to have anything to do with Eric Berntson's vision for S.E. Sask. His view was to build up the oil industry at the benefit of his tight little club and everyone else go fend for themselves. A short-sighted view of a red-neck, bully, populist.In the years since 1987 when I was taken out, life has been a struggle because of the stigma attached of being a mentally ill person. A misdiagnosis if there ever was one. I have busied myself in the years since 1987 as a sales rep, a bit of consulting on business projects, public relations roles for numerous clients in recent years and doing carpentry and construction projects.But I never gave up on the hopes of making Amazing Place a reality someday.Political dirty tricks by Eric Berntson back in 1987 prevented it from happening back then. However Eric Berntson passed away on September 23, 2018 and now that his band of cronies no longer have a need to protect their beloved Eric anymore I'm putting forth this crowdfunding campaign again, called ""Amazing Place""I never had the chance to run for MLA in 1987 because of Eric Berntson's dirty tricks to protect against his alleged improprieties to his adopted daughter and numerous other things.So if anyone would like to see ""Amazing Place"" become a reality, if you would like to be part of a moment of letting the people in general decide as opposed to a corrupt few then please donate. There was international interest in the project and Berntson knew I would've beat him election day. Instead, he peddled influence, trumped up charges and had his daughter and then I systematically thrown in mental hospitals to cover up his dirty laundry.So if you want to be part of a grass roots movement, where you can be part of a movement and a project that is of benefit to everyone, not just an elitist few industrialist corporation's and individuals, then donate to ""Amazing Place""I'm looking for volunteers and manpower and when it's built it will be how the people want it done, at a grass roots level not just a vision of some select self-serving elitist few.Yes you will find things a little in question in the remainder of this entry called ""Amazing Place"" however I decided I would try for some controversy.For years I have lived under the restrictions of the mental health act and all the ridiculous red-tape of it all. A system where the professionals involved are bent on keeping patients rather than giving them a clean bill of health because that reduces their case-load which reduces their income. Yes a corrupt system, but I'll address that some other time.So being a resourceful sort and turning a negative into a positive for the benefit of everyone, here's what's going on in ""Amazing Place"".The system was bent on putting a ""mental"" diagnosis on me, when it was nothing more or less that a dirty political cover-up.Therefore if the system is bent on calling me crazy for the sake of their self-serving job security then lets work with that. Let's use it to our advantage as a drawing card and a curiosity item as you encourage others to visit this ""Amazing Place"" page.If there's going to be a ""mental"" aspect to it then do it to our advantage for the news worthiness and controversy.In the following pages there will be a rather glib but responsible claim to possibly being the second coming of Christ. I no more think that of myself than any other Christian.The second coming of Christ is the collective uplifting of love in everyone’s hearts. The definition of Christ is: the divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all mankind.There for no man or woman who has Christ in their heart is anymore or less important than the next or the other.So if you want to see ""Amazing Place"" built as it would've been some 35-40 years ago except for being stopped to protect a crooked and questionable political career, then donate.You’ll come to a sentence where it says I had a deadline to raise some $800,000 for the property. The deadline doesn't apply anymore. The land is being held for me.I'm looking for donations, investment and fundraisers. If anyone out there raises funds for me I'll give 10 -15% back to the fundraisers in commission.Be part of a grassroots movement where the people decide. Read and decide whether someone with a ""mental"" issue could've written ""Amazing Place"" or not. If you decide I deserve a chance to build the project then donate and bring others to the site as well. Perhaps we'll have a vital and viral campaign as our success.Eric Berntson died on Sept 23/2018. He put my life on hold in the spring of 1987 and cut short some life’s dreams of mine and others at that time. These many years later, I hope to build ""Amazing Place"" and make the economic development plan come about again for the people of S.E. Sask. There's more to building a economy than to focus on just resource based industry. There's trade, manufacturing, secondary education, entertainment, the arts and tourism a true diversity of potential that has been most sorrowfully ignored these last 40 years and are needed here more than ever. Needed to provide jobs so people have more of a choice for a livelihood other than moving away to a city and watch small-town Saskatchewan just get smaller.Donate to this movement.Donate to this cause.I've been capable of building this project for 35 - 40 years. Now it's time to get on with it.So now if you get on with reading ""Amazing Place"" and help in whatever way you can it will be greatly appreciated. Let's leave something to benefit people for generations to come. God BlessSo what do you think? Should we have an ""Amazing Place"" to benefit the world and a sustainable future, in a world of peace and peaceful coexistence.I think so. I've brought the idea up again after close to a 40 year delay. Let's get us back somewhat to a time and a world and headspace that wasn't bent on war and conflict but rather on hope and interactional development and cooperation.A time of Harmony, somewhat.Thank you for reading this.Thank you for realizing I can't do it by myself and donating to the cause.And without further adieu read my original entry entitled ""Amazing Place"" Enjoy!I open this funding page with a quote by Charles Herbert Spencer - 18th Century scientist and philosopher.""There is a principal in life which is a bar against all informationWhich can be used as proof against all argumentsAnd cannot fail to lead to a life of everlasting ignoranceThat principal is contempt, prior to investigation""As you read the rest of this funding request read it through to the end. At the end of it only determines whether you have contempt or consideration for it. Also at the end consider if there is value for the money from what you got out of it by reading it.Either in entertainment, intrigue, value or sense of purpose by donating. If you see a value gained then donate and fund this page accordingly.Hello! My name is Lynn & Thank you for coming to my crowd funding proposal called ""Amazing Place"", which is to be a real estate, cultural, educational, religious, recreational, entertainment and organic farm development.People want value for their money. That being said if you would like to base the size of your donation on value you get out of reading at this site, be it $2, $5, $10, or whatever amount, if nothing else base it on the worth value you get from the Poem that is written at the end of this entry. It is a poem of insight and unique perspective that allows one to feel right about oneself in their day-to-day. A reward to you for reading this entry in its entirety. So if Amazing Place gets the millions of dollars from this site at $2, or $10 or whatever at a time, then that will be the case and with the Peace of Mind that all donors got value for their money.That being said please also refer to the Glen Ewen General Store which gives a bit more on my background and related experience which leaves me capable of building ""Amazing Place""Why did I write this you may ask? After 62 yrs of living I just feel like having my say so and get some things off my mind. For those of you old enough to remember a well-known movie of the mid 70's called Network starring Peter Finch as Howard Beale. A news anchorman who was ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore"", that demonstrates the hidden mood of a lot of people again these days some 40 yrs later.So this is my once every 62 yrs vent of my feelings. By no means do I have any intentions of following in the footsteps of Howard Beale in the movie but by mentioning the movie, it does demonstrate some of my concerns and dissatisfactions with some aspects of the world as it is today. So therefore I propose Amazing Place as the project and solution to some of the needs this world has today and how we all can participate to be part of this project and social movement as the outcome. Please read on to the end. Remember there's a reward at the end if you do. And hopefully you will see the value for the money should you decide to contribute and participate in this project.As follows:My full name is Lionel Lynn Johnson. Born August 15th, 1955. Born in the middle of the night, middle of the month, middle of the decade, in the middle of the 20th century in the middle of the continent. I'm just a middle of road kind of guy.Middle of the road in the regard that you always have to evaluate both sides of an issue before drawing a sensible conclusion. And realize even after the point of conclusion there is still plenty of room for discussion. LOLAccording to history, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace died at the age of 33 and apparently there are clues in the Bible and from seers that 1988 was likely the year for his return to become King. August 15, my birthday was also the first day of Woodstock, the large peace festival which was held in the state of New York in 1969 which launched a great spin-off of peace initiatives in the world.Aside from being born on the same day as a day of Peace, August 15, my birth sign, Leo, is of a king, my first name, Lionel, is reference of a king, and my last name refers to a king. Johnson King John's son. Of course the King John who gave us the Magna Carta in 1215. The Initial Charter and start of Western Civilization and of the democracies we have in it's evolution.As well I am the man who would be king of one of the clans of this area. I was also 33 in 1988 when I was officially confirmed into the United Church of Canada as a member. I grew up in the United Church and upon leaving home at 18 for many years when not regularly attending church I lived the life of a gnostic. In simple terms the individual Christian voice. I kept the 10 commandments as my guide and reference as best I could and only focused on the Red Letter words of Christ in the Bible (KJV) as part of my sensibilities.In later years I attended the Anglican Church and now attend a private independent assembly of worshipers and believers. As a result of my association with the United and Anglican churches for many years I also support the Universal Catholic assembly. As a result of my coincidental entry back to organized religion at the age of 33 in 1988 as the seers said it might happen. I wish to make note I do support the Pope.In Matthew 24 of the Bible it is said that the coming of the Lord to take power would be accompanied by a streak of light in the sky from the east to the west and that no one would know of his time of coming but the Father, perhaps not even the man himself. In the spring 1996, the comet Hyakutaki crossed from east to west in the sky for the first time in recorded history. At the same time I took power over a major continental issue being the primary voice that stopped a large toxic-waste incineration project that would have poisoned millions of people, millions of acres of farmland and water supplies. Yes I was and still can be an environmental activist.In the spring of 1997, the comet Hale-Bopp came as a streak of light from east to west for the first time in recorded history. At the same time I took power back over my life and away from the authorities. This was necessary because in opposition to the toxic waste incineration project the authorities tried to punish me for protecting the earth and its inhabitants by trying to ruin my credibility by creating lies that had me put in a Mental Hospital. This was an attempt to get the incineration project back on board for the sake of money instead of common sense. A green peace executive told me during my stay in the mental hospital ""Don't worry. You can't consider yourself a true environmental activist until you've had at least one trip to the mental hospital"" Lol. They failed and I and the planet won because the waste incinerator project got cancelled.Now where am I going with all this is not to say or claim that I might be the Second coming of Christ. I make no claim on that. I'm just putting forth these circumstances and coincidences in my life to show why I live as just a man and I live simply as a reminder that we are to live in Peace and have no reservations in accepting Jesus Christ as my savior or as an influence in predicating my actions in life.Mathew 24 says no one would know of his time of coming. Perhaps not the man himself not anyone.The true definition of Christ does not refer to the human form. It refers to the ""divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all mankind. That being said, it is my contention that perhaps the second coming of Christ for mankind is the collective uplifting of love and peace through all mankind. With reference to the book of Revelation that ""nation rise up against nation"", why should it not be shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, not fist to fist.If in fact I am he, I will not and will never know it or believe it. All I will believe is that with all the acts of war and terrorism and social unrest and difference in the world that times are getting very uncertain. So much so that leaders are logisticizing and ramping up to a nuclear world war to end North Korea's war initiative. Another unfortunate case of the tail trying to wag the dog.So I say before it's possibly too late I'd like to do my part in starting a peace initiative that others might wish to take part in.How I am going to start it is by building a rural hotel, sanctuary, healing and family retreat complex. The first phase will cost $40,000,000As far as time frame, the first $800,000 must be raised by the first of June 2018 to secure the land, and to keep things on schedule.The next phase will be the building of the lodge, the combination concert hall, meeting, congregation, wedding and worship facility and the private cabins which will be situated around the central facility.Also there will be plans for riding stables and arena, an animal farm, trotting racetrack and stadium, golf course, and an organic farm corporation.The theme will be of a country retreat. Where people can listen to country and western performances and a traditional approach to life. There will be area farms participating, so that people can go out on hayrides, camp fires, ride a tractor or a combine and show the kids some of the rural life with bus tours and car rides in the country. That is of course when they aren't in the pool or on the water slides or being taken to the local skating rink in the winter.It will be a place where all are welcome and hosted for all their many needs. As far as the healing aspect people will be able to come for natural healing by qualified practitioners.For myself I provide products from: Anovite.com/superfood. Where you can find the #1 rated most nutritionally dense and complete food supplement on the planet. This ancient superfood has been known as ""the promise of life"" for centuries. This line of colostrum, corrects a condition in the body that is an affliction 85% of the population. When the affliction is corrected it provides all the building and constituents blocks and stem cell production for the body to correct and to help heal over 400 known autoimmune disorders. Be they mental, arthritis, MS, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, fatigue, stress, heart disease, blockages, cholesterol, fibromyalgia, weight control and much more.Scientific research concludes with the proper nutrition and environment a human should live to a 130 years of age and older. This product reverses aging and is the proper nutrition to extend a healthy life years beyond what one might expect.So there you have it. I want Peace and Peaceful Coexistence to come back to this world and my rural Hotel/Resort will be the model of this ""world community village we strived for after WW11. The war to end all wars supposedly. Now we've been ramping up since 9/11 and after 17 yrs of the struggle against terrorism it almost looks like the terrorist have already won by the turmoil the world is in. I want to build a sustainable meeting, holiday, healing center that is based on an old mantra of decades ago when I was young, an attempt to re-visit the "" world community village"" that my generation strived for in our youth.Unfortunately forces have taken the world away from that time and it's time to bring it back.You may think I'm crazy or eccentric at the very least but when you listen to some of our world leaders ramping up for world war and nuclear confrontation maybe we should all call for peace and do our part to participate in my particular supposed craziness.What if every person in the world decided to forgive and forget and woke up tomorrow in a non combative frame of mind. No need for war or terrorism and the world would be at Peace. It's as simple as everyone stop fighting and show tolerance for our differences not animosity. It's that simple. We could spend our time and money on technology to stop global warming and on green energy infrastructure and really save the planet.However if these are the times of the revelations, lets counter it by building a Peaceful getaway out here on the prairies. And when the 144,000 of the twelve tribes of Israel get done sorting it out in the middle east we can "" invite them all over to break bread on the patio at the hotel and encourage multicultural harmony not rivalry. Perhaps people will be dancing in the streets come that day.Who knows we get one working model going and then build more. This project will be totally off the grid with wind/solar power and hydrogen generator technology. At least we'll do our part for the planet though some world leaders turn a blind eye and refuse to their part.Should you decide to help fund me, I accept it with gratitude, humility and should you come see the place some day you will be greeted, welcomed with respect and dignity. Should you decide not to help out that's ok but please do me the favor of referring others to this page and help get the word around.Recommended reading:The Celestine Prophecy - James RedfieldA Return to Love - Marianne WilliamsonBringers of the Dawn - Barbara Marciniak7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen J Covey""Imagine all the people, living life in Peace.You may say I a dreamerBut I'm not the only one.""John Lennon - The BeatlesGo in Peace Harm No One- Jesus ChristSo folks let's have a bit of fun doing this. When a person takes themselves too seriously that's when problems arise.If 10% of the Christians on the continent of North America all gave me $1.75 each I reach more than my total of $45,000,000. And if you all shared this on Facebook it could happen.If those of you who wished to participate in this project have no congregation that you attend on Sunday, perhaps you might come to this site and make a regular Sunday by Sunday donation in absence of supporting a congregation. Support the ""Amazing Place""A place built on the principles of peace, world community village, equality, and harmony.Once it is built this place of sanctuary and harmony it will embed into the rest of the world a living mantra to hopefully send it. A middle of the road kind of guy who has a sense of humor and just wants the world to lighten up a little. God knows its needed. That's why he told me to say so. Nudge nudge wink wink. My lawyers, Accountants, Architect and the like are in place and a very large hotel chain interest is in the background. Having said that the general over all theme of this development will be an attempt in appearance, character, personality of the late 50's to the late 60's. It was post war the world was relatively at peace and it was a time when the people and the land were relatively in harmony and everybody had hopes and dreams and expectations for the future. We had a strong growing middle class there was always enough to go around and people still made a point of making sure everyone was helped out. Things were still pretty traditional. Music and architecture and home life not unlike the old classic movies. There was a mood of tolerance benevolence and inspiration towards life and progress in general. People felt safe and secure whether it was with their neighbor next door or family or a stranger they met on the street. This is what we wish to embody in this development and attitude towards achieving the end goal and presentation of ""Amazing Place"".We may be able to promote other developers to join in and build something not unlike a small scaled down Branson, MissouriThe sky is the limit. It all starts with an idea.""Build it and they will come""- Field of DreamsSome might be curious about this following point about me. I live as a celibate heterosexual. Decades ago I could have said a gentleman but today no one would get it anymore and I believe that sexual intimacy and love making be between a man and a woman within the institution of marriage. It has been God's wish that marriage is between a man and a woman. Those that would want to change that to include homosexuals are going against God's wish and allowing the tail to wag the dog. Too much of that these days. Homosexuals can have recognized civil unions and be accepted as Christians but I don't approve or recognize an act of marriage between them. It's against God's wish.If you give a donation or not here's an insight that is priceless.How to acquire Peace of mind and feel God's Love:Sit back relax, a few deep breaths then passively and acceptingly feel the emotion of something loving and something beautiful and put those two feelings together.Example:A memory from your youth of being with friends or family and seeing the presents under a beautiful Christmas tree on Christmas morning. At the instant you combine the emotions of love, peace and beauty you will feel a Peace of Mind.If it's a surprise to you when the peaceful sensation happens don't become aggressive towards it because the feeling disappears. You must remain passive and patiently accepting for the feeling of Peace to stay. It takes practice to master it so you can have Peace of Mind all the time.Another insight:Reality is one extreme or the other or somewhere in between. Up or down, happy or sad, good or evil, giving or taking, selfish or generous, stoic or arrogant and so on.Basic psychology only has 2 emotions Love or Fear, or rather Love going the opposite way.So a person goes to or from something in love or feel or neutrality or indifference.From these basics and predicated by the 10 commandments in interpretation a person can figure out or determine what's up or what's best about just about anything and if uncertain about the choice of actions you can use this basic system to figure things out. So with reality as between 2 extremes and with 2 basic emotions how do we exist, within that binary system.I choose to live moving forward, spiritually upward in a caring , considerate, productive and benevolent and helpful regard. All in an effort of achieving Peaceful positive synergy and harmony with the world and people around me. I feel resolved and confident in this state.My politics are similar to my driving habits. I stay close to the middle of the road but a bit off to the right (right minded as opposed to right wing) and some times I use the left lane to bypass some obstacle on the right that slows me down or makes good sense to do so. And I do contend that if you get too far to either side of the road you'll end up stuck in the ditch going no where in a hurry.It's always a case of staying centered and balanced in your determinations of what is truth and what is just and right.""Everything that exists is real""""Anything that is real need not feel fear""""There in lies the Peace of God""From the bookA course in MiraclesI might add to that ""If you feel fear where you're at then where you're at isn't real""""So move in mind or place to a place that gives you Peace.""I'm putting out a call particularly to the baby boomers to help me. Act now and join the cause so we don't become a wasted, forgotten, ineffective and insignificant generation for what we once all believed in like peaceful coexistence may all be lost if we don't remind the world again what our generation stood for or all may be lost. I think otherwise. That's why I want to make this project and frame of mind amongst all people Hopefully you do too. Let's make the difference we are supposed too. So again thank you for your time reading this and again ""Go in Peace, Harm No One""Jesus Christ""Live Long and Prosper""SpockIt maybe the devil or it may be the LordBut you're going to have to serve somebodyBob DylanI choose to serve the Lord.And yes I may be psychic because: ""I can tell by the way you're thinking about me that you don't know whether I'm the real thing or not"" LOLIf I am all I can say is I sure wish they had twin blade razors back 2000 yr ago.""Hope is the greatest antidote for fear""Let us all hope for Peace Everlasting and a sensible outcome in the affairs of this chaotic world. To all you baby boomers out there, we grew up as the generation of Peace and Love"". Let's all live it.Be the change you want to see in the world today.Mahatma GhandiThank you for getting through my some what elongated. Slip of the mind. LOLI do have the practical life expression as to make ""Amazing Place"" a reality and in the midst of all of it keep it fun, and inspirational for everyone. We take the project seriously but not too serious within the project.When you get too serious about anything it takes the versatility of the mind and the heart away to stay inspired and fulfilled in doing a good and beneficial job of anything. That being said, spread the word, create some controversy over this great mystery at hand. Will ""Amazing Place"" come to be ? Always the conundrum. Maybe this sounds a bit off beat or as a departure from the popular approach of divide and conquer, choose up sides, exploit and capitalize that goes on with others these days.Hopefully cool heads will prevail and this Amazing Place will be built in recognition that working and coming together can work instead of divide and conquer.Amazing Place, taking us back to where we should not have left bringing us in to the future with a sustainable followable path. Let's see this place built to show that nice people and their efforts don't have to necessarily finish last.""A hotel, sanctuary, healing, entertainment, vacation, sports, equestrian, place of gathering and worship. Built on the premise of equality, world community, village, love, peace, benevolence and an effort of bringing people together, not by dividing and conquering as some hotel operators would do out there, amongst other things. This project will be a success built on bringing people peacefully together, in the common good, not dividing, conquering and chaos. There will be something for everyone and at an affordable admission price.Now that we're close to the end of this account of request for help in the way of money and as to why, let me state the following:I don't really need 10's of millions to make Amazing Place become a reality. I really only need perhaps 3 million dollars. Enough to purchase the required land and the balance to promote, get marketing and design the concept and then leverage the balance of the money with in visitors participating in the long run. If the money fund raised is in an amount that exceeds the initial 3 million dollars then farm land shall be purchased to start an organic farm corporation to help feed the guests and the world in general. With decent edible food instead of the over processed, chemically doctored food we are almost obligated and forced to eat today for lack of other choice. And as far as me being the second coming, please don't take me too seriously, but take the concept of peaceful coexistence and love amongst man and woman kind is what is intended as the outcome put into the present once Amazing Place is built.Take the project seriously but don't get carried away with too much else.It's all in the name of having some hope having some fun and controversy and goodwill amongst all men as the outcome.Let Amazing Place, it's intent and process be the quantum shift the world needs.A project of bringing the world together in Peace with a common belief in harmony as opposed to the present state of divide and conquer, chaos and threat of nuclear confrontation.Let us all be light hearted and hopeful that Amazing Place soon becomes a reality. Nothing but good will be the outcome of our actions on building ""Amazing Place""Let us all enjoy the task at hand of making it happen. If any opposition to the project or myself arises go tell someone else...After all I'm a lover not a fighter. lolThank you and may you and your future be blessed.Everyone now go and figure. Always the Conundrum lolSo there we have it folks. A proposal to build a project called ""Amazing Place"". To be built for a gathering place for people in the event that a place is required for the Second Coming of Christ to participate.Again I am not claiming to be the 2nd Coming only that I have had coincidences in my life that make others and myself casually quires at the possibility. So if I am not he, and he does show up we'll have a place for him. As well I am not a false prophet for I make no prophecies to speak of. Only that the Second Coming of Christ, yes Christ, by definition the light of Divine Love that is thread through all of us, be apparent, abundant and necessary for the return of Christ to Earth.So why do I attempt to make Amazing Place a reality? I refer to a popular remark of Dr. Wayne Dyer (well-known spiritualist and author) who says,""Don't die with the music still inside of you""Amazing Place will be my version of a harmonious job site and project for the heart and soul. A composition, bricks, mortar, healthy organic farmland, hotels, concert and congregation halls, recreation, education, healing and culture all done in cooperative concert with nothing but good but to come of it.That being said let us refer to the lyrics of a fitting song that suits my mood, my sense of humor and in some sense the mental space of many of the baby boomers o my generation. He's an Old Hippieby the Bellany BrothersLet's make Amazing Place a reality. If for no other reason than it will give us a fun project to work on for the next many years and keep life interesting. One more song lyric to keep in mind Don't worry be happyby Bobby McferronIf they make this into a movie some day, ""I hope it's a comedy"" lol Now here is The Poem I promised to you at the top of the page. A little reward for completing you task a job well done.- ""The Man Without Money (or) Don't Let The Joke Be On You""The man without money is not the man who is broke.Not like the man who can't laugh at a well-meaning joke.People will eat and people will drink and people will eat, drink, and smoke.And some will even deprive or indulge until they nearly choke.Others might lie, cheat, steal, confront or deliberately provoke.Looking to answer the questions that life will invoke.I think here is truth in these words which are spoke.It is always best to focus one's own personal God-given talents.On that which gives life timing, truth, honor, coordination, just cause, just intent, harmony and balance.So please realize there's nothing that badly broke.If you can still laugh at a well-meaning joke.And should you deal fairly, deal honestly with people, not with bullish tactics and greed.The reputation that comes to precede you will be your true fortune indeed.Believe in these words, belief in them is a must.For it gives you a place and a focus that is just, that others will trust.And you'll find you never feel that you will ever lose face.A you walk on through life in a state of Peace, and a state of Dignity and Grace.So please realize there's nothing anywhere near broke.If you can still laugh at a well-meaning joke.Should you try the thought of these lines if only for the heck of it.You'll find you never have to live in spiritual deficit.And for those who don't believe these lines to be possibly true.I tell you my friend the joke is most certain on them not on me, not on you.The EndSo there we have it folks. Value for the money. Donate whatever you deem the value of the poem. Focused and Fine. ""Five bucks for a fine and feisty frame of feeling"", perhaps? lol Or the value of the dream of a place of peace and amazement and being part of helping in the building of ""Amazing Place"". At attempt to bring peace to the world and resolve conflict. All money received is received with humble appreciation, respect and utmost state of responsibility and determination and dedication to get the project done. It will be built by benevolence and goodwill, and so shall it exist and operate in many regards once built.Why will it be an ""Amazing Place""? It will, because of amazing and abundant response to this project that it will help create jobs, heal people, heal the land, give the contributing people of the world something to take part in. A real cause.Everlasting peace and harmony amongst the people of the world. And a sustainable planet, environment, ecosystem, and political climate. Yes an Amazing Project, Place and Movement.""Amazing Place""Achievable conceivable $2, $5, $10 at a time. Make a game of how many you can bring to the site. Maybe the $40 million will be here by summer next summer or several summers after that. You never know. We'll just make it a pet project of ours to save the planet. No matter how long it takes. Let us all ""rise to the mountain tops to see the Promise Land"" - paraphrase of Dr. Martin Luther King.Maybe you should leave a couple of bucks behind just in case I might be the second coming. I can use it for getting rid of the possible bad issues and bad guys that might come to be or in fact might already be. Refer to Revelations in the bible.The anti Christ has the number 666 associated with him. The address 555 - 5th Ave NY, NY belongs to a building owned by a well known billionaire. ( go out and google to see who it is) On one floor of that building is a company called Lucifer Technologies. They are the developers of micro-chip technologies that are already being put in humans for identification purposes in some companies. Bearing the mark of the Beast of the earth so to speak.There's a large banking computer in Brussels, Belgium that apparently has been accumulating and recording everyone in the world banking system and giving them a number. A triple six digit coding system is at the bottom of it. This computer is speculated to be the Beast of the Earth by some. Intended to take away a person's independence's, rights and freedoms in so many ways. With a few of these apparencies one can only speculate as to the implications or the outcome. One can only wonder.I draw no conclusions other than to be wary of these present day activities and to make my efforts as best I can to help the planet through these unsettled times and to work for the best outcome and resolve for as many as possible. I draw no conclusions on the afore mentioned people or places perhaps. Judge not lest you be judged.So if you'd like to help me out, just in case, your contribution will be appreciated in the utmost.Am I the Second Coming. Who knows for sure. No one ever will probably. All I can say is why did God lead me to notice the coincidences in my life that lead me and others to wonder if I really might be.Go figure.I wish no one any harm, and one purpose of mine is to appeal to the U.S. and N. Korea to de-escalate their confrontation.Ramped up much further and everyone on the planet is a loser in some regard as a result of what could transpire.An old 1960's montra went as follows:Make Love Not War. So since 9/11 it has been ramping up with more and more rivalries, conflicts and animosities in the world than ever before.Remember the rather hopeful calm and progressive confidence there was in the world and a general state of over all well-being before 9/11.All I can ask now is whatever happened to Make Love Not War?People, people, people, where is the love that once was?People, people, people, where is the love.Remember in order to save the world it has to be a group effort. Everyone sharing in the satisfaction of doing something worth while. There may be a very significant need for a world effort for peace and a disarming of minds and battlefields. If you are going to donate I will close with this poem called."" The joke is on You"" or ""The Man Without Money"" as you prefer. If after hearing/reading it  gives you a sense that everyone is ok in the thought and it's a good way to lift the spirits. Then give this project what you think the poem is worth. How about Five Bucks For The Feel Good Factor. lolHelp save the world for $5. The outcome of doing so will be heavenly.This may come as madcap or tongue in cheek reading to you in some regard. I try to keep it lighthearted and humorous but only to be good medicine to the mind. But please be rest assured any donation received and no matter how many millions raised or other assistance provided it will be received with the utmost of respect, humility, care, responsibility and conscientiousness. So thank you ahead of time.Lynn Johnson just a middle of the road regular kind of guy who wants to do something meaningful for the world. In the words of a Paul Simon song ""Don't want to end up a cartoon in a cartoon graveyard""""Peace"" is the theme of this year's Winter Olympics on at this time. Valentine's Day is near so I thought I'd release this to coincide with a time of Love and Peace in the world. As an attempt to bring back even more love and peace to the world and in the years to come. For the love of the planet, the people and all creation.We are all custodians of this planet. Let's take collectively better care of it than we have of late, environmentally, socially, politically. People! People! People!Where is the Peace we all once knew? Especially before 9/11Let us recover and recapture and contribute the missing peace in the building of Amazing PlaceAs for myself I am a low key ,retiring sort who lives a basic, practical life on a small gov't pension, an occasional commissioned sale of green energy with a wind turbine company at www.kelsoenergy.com , some odd jobs and the occasional bit of design and reno carpentry projects. I also buy and sell a bit of used practical and collectible goods I seem to get by and the money that I make helps to look after my 87 year old mother and others that I give help to when I have the change to spare.I guess that's why I have to ask the world to help me in this campaign for mine was spent helping others already. I ask the world for its help so that I can repay the world back by helping reestablish a place in it of peace and love that shall spread through out the world for the day to arrive of everlasting peace.I am not an extravagant or wasteful man and I consider myself quite practical most of the time and that is how I will deal with all funds raised for Amazing Place.So please contribute to this cause, this movement. Ask others to come to this site and do likewise. Make a difference.Nothing ventured, Nothing gained! Let's attempt to make this site experience visitors in a viral, spiral. lol No I'm not crazy and I haven't slipped a gear. It's just a case that the older one gets the more they tend to speak what's on their mind and in their heart than what you think the world expects of you. I guess that's true in my case.Besides i was curious what would come of it if I did do as I have just done , namely releasing this campaign called""Amazing Place"" That and the need to keep life hopeful and interesting for as many as possible.Join the cause and the movement, make a difference, and at least say you tried and gave it an honest attempt Nothing ventured, Nothing gained.If nothing else I hope I have given you food for thought. I hope that they're heavenly thoughts. LOLAnd have a happy and abundant life.I don't ask in you giving a donation that you choose to believe in me as the second coming. I ask you to donate in your belief in God, in love, in peace, good will toward your fellow man and respect for the creatures and all life on the planet.Amazing Place will come to be, not for me, but for everyone who believes in Christ, in the Divine light of love that is thread through the heart of all God's creation.Amazing Place and this planet will be for everyone who comes in Peace and God's love which is Christ. All contributions to this project are to be administrated by a Christian Organization in background. This organization exists as a independent congregation and benevolent charitable organization and is registered as such with gov't and CRA. Conducting activities such as Amazing Place is just one of it's projects.So give and be a part of ""Amazing Place"", a part of something bigger than us all, a ""movement"" refreshed and renewed in the direction of ""Everlasting World Peace"". We've been a state of escalating conflict and war in the world since 911.Let's face it world leadership in many regards has become  ""bunker-lunky"".We need a quantum shift and a focused shift to world peace.Sign on with Amazing Place and make it a notable part of the world movement for Peace and World Community village. Sign on. You have to believe in and stand for something or you will fall for anything. Believe in and stand for Christ and Peace and in Amazing Place to be that vehicle. Believe and act or react upon this moment to make it happen and thanks for your time and donation to help spread the word and make Amazing Place and all it stands for a reality. Thank you.So now that you have read the entire entry do you see any value to it? If so, donate and fund accordingly and spread the word.If you take contempt that I might be the second coming. That the ominous consideration of the book of Revelations might well be right. That might be a just reaction. No one wants those occurrences to come about.I am simply hopefully that some of the spiritual sources I have been in touch with those seers claiming that the real second coming of Christ is not for another 3200 years or so. That there are powers and influences on this planet that are trying to concoct a false state of Revelations of this time of man that will be false Revelations, but destructive and tumultuous to man and the planet nonetheless I'm just trying to diffuse the situation as gently and tactfully as I only remain hopeful that the pendulum of war, chaos and conflict that is upon this world and I'm calling upon the help of others the help of the planet would be nice. If you decide to pitch in and donate and help it would be for a good cause. World peace, safety and sanctuary. May I please imply a sense of urgency in my request for help and spreading the word. ""Every one lives at the hands of the other mans mercy"" Hopefully the pendulum will soon start to swing the other way and there will be a peaceful sustainable outcome for us one and all in the process. Imagine all the peopleliving the life in Peace, you too. You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you join us and the world will live as one.John LennonSo there we all are. Close to the end of the appeal for funding of Amazing Place.Should you fund, look upon it as an act of contributing to a project that's intended to help save the world, if need be. With all the apparencies out there working towards the circumstances of the times of the Revelations it may well need be. I don't want the times of the Revelations and all it's horrors to occur any more than most. However there are forces and influences on this earth and in this universe that are bent on bringing these times upon us. Best to be prepared as best we can to keep the outcome what it is to be. A matter of playing it safe as best we can for a planet of everlasting peace.Food for thought Food for thought.Thank you for reading this entry and thank you in advance for your assistance in helping to bring a final lasting peaceful salvation to this planet.Food for thought food for thoughtPrepare for the worst, work for and hope and strive for the best.Footnote : It would be remiss of me not to mention death of Reverend Billy Graham (an American Evangelist) on Feb. 21, 2018. With this funding page of mine focused somewhat on Christ as the theme one should ask that we remember Rev. Graham in kindness as a man who brought literally millions to the fold and counselled everyone from common man to presidents over many decades of ministry.God Bless and God raise Rev. Billy Graham on highAmenAfter reading all the above, one might ask ""So am I really the second coming or not?"" I guess we'll never know for sure. ""Always the conundrum. Always the conundrum.""While we're all busy trying to figure it out lets build ""Amazing Place""It'll give us something constructive to do with our time. Am I or am I not?

Bill C-51 is part of a long string of initiatives to expand the government’s security powers and signals a dramatic new direction for Canadian security. Presented as anti-terror legislation, Bill C-51 creates excessive over reaching powers for security agencies, that will harm online innovation, political discourse, and our civil liberties.The Conservative Government is rushing this bill through parliament without responsible parliamentary process. The actions of the government are degrading our democracy and our international reputation. This bill disproportionately targets indigenous communities, environmental activists, dissidents, and Muslims, many of whom are already subjected to questionable and overreaching powers by security officials. Bill C-51 will make it easier and ostensibly lawful for government to continue infringing upon the rights of peaceful people.“Bill C-51… is a dangerous piece of legislation in terms of its potential impacts on the rule of law, on constitutionally and internationally protected rights, and on the health of Canada’s democracy”-106 Law professors from across Canada in and Open Letter to the Government criticizing Bill C-51Any government that would propose legislation that is unconstitutional and undemocratic does not have the moral authority to maintain power in a true democracy.

Carl AC ,"Toronto, ON",Other,"Canada has always been a refuge for those fleeing persecution and war. But in April 2012, that started to change . That's when the Federal Government announced devastating cuts to healthcare for refugees in Canada. Since that time, tens of thousands of vulnerable refugees in our country - including infants and children - have lost healthcare coverage or been denied coverage all together. The results have been disastrous. Diabetic refugees have gone without insulin. Pregnant refugees have gone without pre-natal care. And refugees with cancer have been told they will no longer receive treatment. In February 2013, the Canadian Association of Refugee  Lawyers (CARL) - along with Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care - could not sit idle any longer. We launched a law suit arguing that the Government's healthcare cuts were illegal. After a year and a half of litigation, the Federal Court agreed. In July 2014, the Court declared that the healthcare cuts violated the Canada's constitution and were a form of ""cruel and unusual"" treatment. But the Federal Government has not given up. In October 2014, they appealed the judgment to the Federal Court of Appeal. And the case may eventually end up in the Supreme Court of Canada. The Canadian Medical Association and 11 other national medical organizations have publicly asked Ottawa to drop the appeal. But the Federal Government has refused. They have the resources - taxpayers' resources - to fund this type of lengthy litigation. CARL does not. Our lawyers have worked hundreds of free hours on this case. And they have promised to continue to do so. But costs associated with this legal battle are steadily mounting - especially for an all-volunteer organization like CARL.So we are calling on Canadians who support refugees to help us out with whatever support you can. Even $5 or $10 can make a real difference when we all come together. We are setting a goal of $12,000 because we think this is close to what we will need to fight this case inside and outside of the courts. None of this money will go to pay our lawyers; all of it will be used to advocate on behalf of refugees who need support and protection. If there is any left over money, it will be used for CARL's future refugee justice workWe need you to be part of this amazing effort to restore healthcare to refugees in Canada. On behalf of refugees across the country, thank you for your support!More resources:CARL's website: [http://www.carl-acaadr.ca/]Federal Court judgment:  [http://goo.gl/Z9AX3M]Globe and Mail editorial: ""Cruel to take health care away from refugee claimants""[http://goo.gl/3L9dIh]Toronto Star editorial: ""Ottawa should reverse cuts to refugee health care""[http://goo.gl/jcBxSu]Ottawa Citizen editorial: ""Refugee rules are bad policy, legal or not""[http://goo.gl/yqQ9xs]Canadian Medical Association: ""CMA urges feds to reconsider appeal against reinstating refugee benefits""[http://goo.gl/tx1BMo]""Twelve national medical associations join call for Conservative government to drop reckless appeal of refugee health ruling"" [http://www.doctorsforrefugeecare.ca/]Full press coverage: [http://goo.gl/wnXdfW]","November 2, 2014","$9,330","$12,000 "
Jonathan Cathey ,"Bozeman, MT",Funerals & Memorials,"My story.  Well to start with, how about I simply tell you what I want.  I wish to honor my late father Kent Cathey, with a memorial bike ride across Texas, which will be about 1,000 miles & take me about 2-3 weeks.  I lost my dad to suicide back in 2008.  3 years prior to that, I lost him to addiction of pharmaceutical meds.  Yet that,,,,is a whole different story.  I hope to be somewhere in Texas by my birthday, and shortly start the ride in the Northwest corner of the Panhandle.  From then on I will be pedaling,,,and pedaling.  I plan to take rest days in Abilene, Fredericksberg, San Antonio, and with a final near South Padre.   This story will be one of many, and this is just the beginning.  Over the next several weeks I will be posting many short biographical stories leading up to this ride.  Part of the point for the ride is to share my testimony and gain support for a nonprofit that I would like to start while back home in Texas.  I would certainly enjoy visiting with all friends & family that can come during rest spots, or anytime along the way.  The other point, well to simply enjoy the ride.  I turn 40 this year, and I would really appreciate your support to allow me to start it off with this adventure.   I have been on some pretty epic adventures up til now, and consider myself to be a very lucky guy.  I don't come from much, and I have achieved a lot.  I don't make a ton of money, but I live a bountiful life.  I have had some amazing ups, and my fair share of extreme downs.  Through all of it there is one thing I am certain of,,,,none of my life....is what most would consider to be ""normal"".  Nothing of my life has been conventional nor conservative, other than some of my beliefs.   Why the ride?  For a guy born on April Fool’s Day, in the panhandle of Texas called Dumas(sometimes pronounced Dumbass), and with a girl’s name for a surname, Cathey??  Why not?  I joke, but I do have an end goal.  I need your help financially to make this ride even possible, and to help me get my nonprofit concept going.  I wish to form an organization that focuses on combating a psychological disorder I have struggled with my entire life, Depression.  It's a problem with so many facets, complex to each individual who suffers from it.  There is no cure, no magical pill that makes it all disappear.  Yet the one thing that I have found to help is simply sharing with one another, and a lifestyle committed to staying rooted in connection to the outdoors.  I am a great risk taker, but a horrible planner.  Over the next few weeks I will be getting help & support from family & friends as I begin the final stages of this commitment.  Whether I raise my goal or not, I fully intend to embark upon this adventure.  Sometimes a soul just knows what it has to do,,,,,it feels called.  I may not have a job when I return home,,,,I may not even have the same home to return too.  The basis of this whole event is from a simple thought, that turns into a desire,,,,,that desire, with a little passion, turns into a commitment.  My heart is committed to this trip.  There is no turning back now. Please help me on this ""Forrest Gump"" style of adventure and discovery.  I just feel the need to ride, in a similar way Forrest felt the need to start running.  Realistically I cannot spend the next few years of my life riding from coast to coast, for the original notion of this adventure was to ride from Canada to Mexico.  The rational sense within me, however small it may be, has condensed the concept down to simply crossing Texas.  Mind you Texas is literally about half of the trip from Brownsville up to Canada through the Dakotas.....just saying.  The trip may have changed yet my desire has not.  I want to remember my father, to celebrate him, and to create a better legacy than the one he left behind. ***Campaign Update***  April 8thAs the time for this trip drew closer, I truly had no clue if it would/could really happen.  So many little details to plan, so far to drive to even begin riding. Yet here I am, 35 miles done with so much more to go.  The trip itself has been a work in progress, and is still unfolding in front of me.  I am living by Faith. From this point forward, I will be pushing hard core for fundraising.  Not just to complete the trip, but also to begin the process for starting my own nonprofit idea Armadillo Adventures.  Another facet to it that is important to me is a part of my story as well.  As a Veteran from the US Navy, I plan to be working with wounded Vets and those suffering from PTSD through my organization.  So, from this point on I will be donating 20% of the funds  to go towards the Wounded Warrior Project.  GoFundMe gets about 10% with fees n such, and I really want to show my support towards something else that will be a part of my organization once up and running.  Please continue to show me your support and keep posted as I continue updates along the way.  There is also a facebook event that I posted that will have daily updates along the way.  Thanks to all!******update ended***** Come share my story.....Come share my sense of adventure....and if you can,,,,,Come along and enjoy the ride.  If you have any questions, want to join in on the ride.  Please email me at armadilloadventurer@hotmail or simply give me a call.  I am nervous/excited/scared out of my mind,,,,,but this trip will be one of a lifetime!","February 17, 2015","$2,274","$5,000 "
Charlie Gray ,"Kitchener, ON","Creative Arts, Music & Film","You’re writing a book, Charlie?Yes! A whole book, headed for publication :),Hello wonderful people, thank you so much for taking an interest in my most recent project, a book I am writing entitled, “In Search of Fire.” The book is a memoir-travelogue about my personal experience navigating faith and sexuality. The story weaves in and out of past and present realities of conservative religion’s impact on my life, as I heal from and celebrate learning who I was, who I am, and who I am evolving into. In short, I am sharing my story of coming out – coming out of conservative Christianity and coming out as a non-heterosexual woman. I hope to finish the book by September 2018, and then publish within the next year or so. But for this to be made sustainable, I am asking for your financial support, if you are able and interested in contributing to my work.What kind of work have you done before, Charlie?I have been a writer since I first learned how to sort letters beside each other. I've always been a poet at heart, but my passion for social justice morphed into a writing career that became about sharing and reporting other people's stories. Captivated by resilience, the stories I have been blessed to hold and share have included working with refugees to articulate their experiences, assisting individuals with exceptional mental and physical needs to express themselves, and reporting alongside Palestinians and Israelis non-violently struggling against Israel's illegal occupation. But the shifting sands of my life over the last year have brought me back to the Middle East – this time to look inwards, to share outwardly a story that I know is also important to tell: my own.[check out examples of my photography and writing here! www.charliethegray.com ]So where exactly are you now, Charlie?I recently left my career in Canada in the humanitarian sector due to discrimination in the organization I was working for over the last three years. This particular NGO has a hiring policy that discriminates against those who are LGBTQ+ or are sexually active outside a heterosexual marriage. I chose to live in the closet to work for the organization because I believed in their work on the ground and also thought I could be a part of positive change from within. Though I lived with a constant fear of losing my job, I believed in the struggle for the sake of change. Fairly quickly however, this struggle took a significant toll on my mental health, and I decided to resign in the fall of 2017. I have used pain of this decision as an opportunity to be open about these issues and my story, with the hopes of one day living in a world where such policies do not exist.So, I packed up my life and moved across the world to the Middle East in search of… well, you’ll have to read the book ;). I have found myself swimming in my own words along the shores of the Gulf of Aqaba, in a little Egyptian coastal town called Dahab, in South Sinai. This area captivated my attention as a young child pouring over the maps and stories of the Christian Biblical scriptures I grew up with back in Canada. Over my life, my relationship with this land morphed into a political and personal one, as I have developed friendships and memories while living here. This deeply religious region has now become for me a context to process my unique denomination of Christianity’s upbringing and its impact on who I am today, in hopes that sharing my story will bring hope and healing to many others.What exactly are you asking for, Charlie?Though this is in some ways difficult and vulnerable for me to ask, I am asking for financial support for the writing process of this book. I have been inspired and encouraged by other people willing to share their own stories of coming out, healing, and celebrating their sexuality, and I hope to do the same by being open about my own experiences. I write this book not only for myself but in the hopes that my story brings solidarity and understanding to others.Money raised here will help me to focus on my writing by covering my basic needs from now until the end of September when I plan for the book to be finished and begin the process of finding a publisher. I live simply and will be a grateful steward of your support. Here on the other side of the world from where I was born and raised, I am in Sinai trying to understand and capture the most challenging story I’ve been given as a writer: mine. If you find yourself believing in me, the writing, and/or the cause, any contribution will be received with much gratitude!!Thank you SO MUCH for your time and willingness to listen. All contributions will be received with so many cyber-hugs :D,xo,Charlie (Carolyn) Gray","March 31, 2018","$1,940","$10,000 "

But as a young couple with a toddler, only five adult family members who don't even live in the same state, and student debt, we're having a hard time getting the funds.The cost to renounce citizenship in the US is about $2,500. According to the lawyer we contacted about immigration eligibility to Canada, it will be about $3,000 to gain citizenship between lawyer fees and paperwork for the three of us. Then between a down payment for a house ($5,000-$15,000), removing student loan debt ($13,000) and car debt ($7,000), and moving fees like trucks, movers, hotels, food, etc ($5,000).We are eligible to move. Canada pre-approved our applications, so the money would definitely not be in vain.How conservatives would benefit from us leaving: One less lesbian couple in the countryI am very active in political movements, vote in every election, call senators, write letters, go to debates, educate others. You don't want that, do you?I am a scientist. I believe in climate change.I read scholarly journals and spread what they say as part of my liberal agendaI am well-versed in gender studies and could convert your kids.I am an atheist.I believe in proper sex education, easy access to birth control, women having bodily autonomy, and access to safe abortions. I believe in gun regulations, as cars are regulated. I guess that means I want to take away your guns. Spooky scary.Without the electoral college, elected officials would win by popular vote, not electoral. I want to abolish it.I believe in protecting refugees.I believe in cutting the military budget in half to fund infrastructure. I believe in taxing the rich. In fact, I believe in a 70% marginal tax rate.I believe in raising the minimum wage.I believe in universal healthcare.There's much more scary things you have expressed several times you want out. The reason why you would want me out because of it is because if we are unable to get out before my child starts school, I'm going to begin running for office and working my way up until I'm a senator or house representative. I won't stop. I pose a threat.So anyway we would be very grateful if you would aid us in making your dreams a reality. Thank you and God bless.","January 20, 2020",0,"$40,000 goal"

Help Jahearme Dennis find Dallas Hello fellow Americans. My dear conservative friend Jeremy Dennis is in desperate need and he has too much pride to take any leftist handouts. Jahearme is a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. Get ready, here’s the tragic part. He’s never been to Dallas! No matter how many maps you put in front of him and after several hints he always points to Canada.

Doctors have diagnosed him with Early 90s nostalgia bandwagon syndrome. When these bandwagon fans are diagnosed they can never snap out of it. It’s a life long curse!!  After watching season after season of countless beat downs for the last 20 years the common side effect of this is severe denial. This dramatically affects the part of the  brain were common sense and reason take place.  All they can say is. “WE DEM BOYS” 

if we reach our goal of $75 this can provide him a Geography for dummy’s book and some longerties.

It’s tie season at American Furniture Warehouse and he currently can only afford the ones he steals from his sons Build-a-Bear collection.Please help him find Dallas and help him be within dress code per the AFW policy book

Who , what , where , why and how Officially, I’m just a debt slave but I am a Human being having a spiritual experience with a medical emergency in a time when it’s incredibly popular to be dehumanizing. Sometimes fundraising events take a couple of years to garner high-level support, unfortunately time isn’t something that I have the privilege of  . God didn’t  give me a JOB with a broken hand  and you know Satan don’t   give you a credit card without one !  

Here in Canada under the present unemployment  legislation working class Canadians are  being denied a medical ei claim due to the dehumanizing regulations and penalties attached with regular claim  legislation , so what’s medical benefits for?! You would think it’s insurance that you pay into that keeps you off a soup line or worst the cold foundations that our cities are built on when you have and incident that leaves you unable to work and I know all  this because this is my third  time in my Entire life that I’ve had to apply for medical benefits  and it’s the first time I was denied, second time I was discriminated and I hoping this  time will be charm and my experiences can help change legislation to keep my country men Out of a Soup line in this increasing popularized dehumanizing pursuit of increased middle class homelessness I am in, with both feet and my one good hand ! 

We live in a time of high tech communication and there’s no excuse for never being properly informed or having your benefits put on hold for biased reasons from within the minds of our federal employees. hence ;  Attorney General of Canada v Kos, 2005 FCA 319. The key issue here was whether file notes by an insurance officer constituted a “decision” that triggered the time limit. The court ruled that it did not, in part because the notes were not communicated to the claimant . 

 If I’d  been properly informed in any of my inquiries over the last year either by mail , telephone or in person in any of the service Canada center's leading up to this frightening humiliating life changing experience I might not be panhandling for real change asking for spare change today, living in a RV , displaced , bruised , broken and permanently scared With no clue were my next hot meal is coming from after preparing and serving tens of thousands of hot meals in remote services to the working classes but here  I-am and I think our medical unemployment should be there not matter what, for all Canadians who get injured just as much as our government is there for American stock holders in an old pipeline , SNC Lavalin and the Highly affluent Irving family , don't you?! 

It’s in these times you find out who your friends, family , co workers  and society are while trying to understand why the government of Canada is middle aged white cat that doesn’t care for salad or the working classes .

 I’ve  enlisted  the assistant of Cathy McLeod  a Conservative MP in Kamloops BC and I’m eagerly awaiting to plant my feet and connect the dots with Bob Zimer Conservative MP who has had his office intervene 3 times with unemployment benefits . I have 5 more Weeks before my  hand is healed and with your help and my determination we can make real changes with a party that promises to be the People’s representation while Justin Trudeau is campaigning for a better Canada and  forgiving 7.4 million in  loans ?! 

In closing I am full of hope for what we can accomplish by working together and alongside our Newly sworn in MPs 

We are the change and With great appreciation I thank you for your time , support and donations.

Natalie Mehra ,"North York, ON",Celebrations & Events,"Want to save our public health services? Want to save our Public Health Units, ambulance services, local hospitals and long-term care homes? Let’s stand together and insist the Ontario government expand, not cut, our local health services.We have a very urgent opportunity to stop major Doug Ford health cuts and closures that will go ahead starting in January unless we levy enough pressure to stop them. Already, the fight-back has Mr. Ford rolling back some cuts and delaying others. The Doug Ford government intends to:- Cut funding for and eliminate 25 out of 35 local public health units across Ontario;- Eliminate 49 out of 59 local paramedic & ambulance services, and eliminate 12 of 22 local dispatch units;- Impose more real-dollar cuts to local hospitals,- Impose real-dollar cuts to long term care homes and cancel two special funds that provide support to long-term care homes.- We are also hearing about home care services being privatized in local communities and there are major cuts to care provision staff in the provincial agencies including the LHINs.Click here for a full list of health care cuts and closures. The Event: We are mounting a campaign to make visible the opposition to the cuts and to mount maximum political pressure possible to save these vital local health care services and stop the cuts and closures.  Click here for more information. Locations and Times: Saturday November 2, 11:00 a.m. at the John D. Bradley Convention Centre in ChathamSaturday November 9, 11:30 a.m. at Nathan Phillips Square in TorontoSaturday November 30, 12 p.m. at the George Leach Centre, Algoma University in Sault Ste. MarieSaturday December 7, 11:00 a.m. at TD Place Arena, Lansdowne Park in Ottawa Why Will this Event Succeed?We know that we can succeed because already, under political pressure that we have helped to build so far, Doug Ford has delayed the cuts to the special long-term care funds twice. He now plans to go ahead next year. He has cancelled the retroactive part of the public health cuts and reduced the amount of the cuts. His government has reopened and kept open hospital surge beds, thanks to your help across Ontario to make this a major issue in our rallies and media work over the last year.  Mr. Ford has not yet moved ahead with privatizing hospital diagnostics and surgeries as Conservative governments have tried to do across Canada. And he has promised to consult.  So, he is moving on these issues, but not enough. But we need to do more. Doug Ford still plans to move ahead with the elimination of more than 86 vital local health services and engage in massive restructuring that will take tens or hundreds of millions of dollars away from care and result in turmoil for years. He is still cutting hospital funding and long-term care daily care funding in real-dollar terms, forcing ever more shortfalls in services. Privatization of home care is marching ahead and major cuts have been made to former provincial agencies that provided vital services in health care. We can make a difference.  When we fight back, we regularly win.  We have saved dozens of hospitals, vital services, stopped privatization every time it has been tried, improved funding for community care and much much more.Who is the Ontario Health Coalition?We are a non-profit, non-partisan public interest activist coalition and network. Our primary goal is to protect and improve our public health care system. We work to honour and strengthen the principles of the Canada Health Act. We are led by our shared commitment to core values of equality, democracy, social inclusion and social justice; and by the five principles of the Act: universality; comprehensiveness; portability; accessibility and public administration.How Will Funds be Used?The money donated will go towards helping us organize these 4 stadium-filling events.- Each $25 buys a giant lawn sign announcing the stadium events and making them visible to thousands of people. We are putting them on busy streets and concessions in each town.- Each $50 buys 1000 YouTube video ads.- Each $100 enables us to get a leaflet out to 3,000 households.- Each $1,200 can fill a busload of people to come out to the major stadium events.- Each $1,000-$5,000 buys a stadium to host these venues and the staging & sound system to make these events possible.Any donation is greatly appreciated! Please spread the word to save our local health services.","October 25, 2019",0,"$20,000 goal"
Tia Maria ,"Nepean, ON","Missions, Faith & Church","Bishop Christopher Senyonjo and I at the November 2014 Reformation Project Conference in DC.My story begins like most Christians who were raised in the faith; Church on Sundays, Pioneer Kids on wednesdays and only one interpretation of homosexuality in relation to the Bible. Around the age of ten Canada was making some big political and federal strides with marriage equality and anxiety overwhelmed my heart. My mother and I were reading the ""Left Behind"" series ( for those of you who are not familiar, it discusses the rapture) and my concern was not for the theives or murderers , mine was for LGBT people. I remember asking my mom how people knew they were gay and wanted to be tested to I could gaurentee my Salvation. My mother one of the most open-minded and logical thinkers talked me through this but I didn't feel satisfied, especially when in conversation with my very HOMOPHOBIC father. His attitudes eventually lead me to stop going to church. He did not think it was ok to be a ""buffet believer"" (those who simply pick and choose aspects of the Bible to follow and not others). So I left the Church and my Christian identity. It's not a surprise however that roughly three years later my father came out.... as a woman. Yup, you got it,  my ultra conservative Christian father was in fact a woman, who wudda thunk! This discovery was both shocking and yet not so shocking to those who belive in the motto ""Thou doth protest too much"". I couldn't really enjoy the ""I told ya so"" moment, because She was about to embark on the hardest journey of her life and our family would undergo some of the darkest seasons ever. My mother and sisters and I were all encourgaing and accepting and played a huge role in her transitioning. This included but was not limited to going shopping for more feminine attire, hormone injections, application of numbing cream for electrolisis treatments ect. NOTE: It's hard enough for teenagers to go in public with their parents, but my sisters were champions who praised on my dad in public as she tried on skirts and dresses for the first time in front of several disapproving onlookers. Despite the encouragement from our immediate family, my dad was rejected by many family friends all in the name of Jesus. My father held onto her faith, but the cruel treatment she endured hardened the hearts of those who knew this was not a choice, a lifestyle or as some proposed ""a mid-life crisis"", this was who God made her to be. Amanda (my dad) never did pass as her true gender and suffered the consequences of living a life that challenged heteronormative values and dress. In addition to her Gender Dysphoria diagnosis she would also battle depression, OCD, bi-polar disorder and narcassistic personality disorder. The following years were a living hell.....I attended Wilfrid Laurier University in 2009 and did my undergrad in Sociology with a minor in Psychology. While at university I immersed myself in the queer community and felt a sense of safety and home that the Church no longer provided. I found myself going to drag shows weekly and prided myself on my ability to rhinestone costumes for preforming friends. My years at Laurier were crucial in the process of becoming the radical Jesus-loving feminist I am today. I cherish those years I spent in gay bars and coffee shops. It opened my mind but more importantly my heart. My two closest friends I met at Laurier were both Christian and also affirming which lead me to attend Church again for the first time in several years. I was trying to negotiate my faith and my academic position but failed to create a response other than, I know I believe in equality and I know I believe in Jesus.... sue me. *** Do not use this argument, it has many loop holes and flaws to it, and allows no room for dialogue. Really it ends there ! Simultaneously however an old family friend Betsy, the wife of a Pastor had her own epiphany in regards to LGBT treatment and inclusion, or should I say , lack there of, of her own. She began posting passionately on Facebook about Biblical teachings and misinterpretations of the Bible. I spent a lot of time on her Facebook the following year. Betsy didn't have a change of heart, her heart was always gold, she had a change of interpretation. A new framework, new language, new knowledge, and she was preaching from the rooftops. I continued to ""follow"" Betsy while I pursued my Masters in Women and Gender studies at the University College of Dublin in Ireland and exchanged thoughts a few times. She really challenged me to engage with the Christian community which I was largely unwilling to do. On January 11th 2014 Amanda took her life, and I would fly home three days later for her funeral. I was relieved to know she was no longer suffering yet burdened by anxiety and overwhelmed by the helplessness she must have felt before stepping off the ladder that evening. My mom initially wanted a private funeral , but much to our surprise many people asked that they be included. My mom selflessly agreed and a beautiful service was held for Amanda , formerly known as Gordon once Karly and I were both home. Betsy prepared the most beautiful service ever despite the challenging circumstances we were gathering under. Her grace that day surmounted above all the pain and akwardness, because let me tell you..... a suicide funeral is tough, but explaining to people who attended my parents wedding 28 years prior who were unaware of Gord's sex change was well.... AKWARD. Yet through it all, we were blessed with love around us.  Betsy's daughter Ket along with my God brother Zach closed the service with an acoustic version of Rod Stewarts' Rhythm of my Heart.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t__F3v3lOSgAfter completing my masters (Glory be to God and all those who supported me during this period of time)   I returned to Canada. Betsy had just finished a course under the supervision of Mathew Vines ( Arguably one of today's most influencial Christian gay-rights activists) and invited me to attend his conference that Novemeber in Washington DC. Here is a link to the conference, I think it speaks for itself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHTdL8Sc8iU&feature=share&fb_ref=shareWith a renewed sense of energy I applied for the following Leadership Cohort and alongside 35 stellar people was chosen to engage in a 12-week rigorous course to train us on Biblical theology , both affirming and non-affirming. This brings me to where I am now ! As part of this training we will attend another conference in DC this coming April. The class of 35 have been asked to raise collectively 40,000 US $ . I set my personal goal at 2000$ and am confident I can crush this with YOUR help.

Stephen Watt ,"Toronto, ON","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","Name: JohnProfile: Young gay man living in offshore detention on NauruStatus: No refugee status, no hope of resettlement to New Zealand or AustraliaThe Opportunity: Private sponsorship to CanadaFinancial Need: $17,500 CAD His storyJohn grew up in a small conservative village in south Asia. When he was just 21, he and a friend were fooling around when they were caught on video. The man shooting was someone that John considered a good friend. That friend then then shared the video widely, a cruel act of exposure in their rural community. What followed was an ordeal of public shaming and violence by gangs of other boys. His brother took part in the beatings.The video had gone viral. He could not face his parents. Nowhere in his country was safe. He had to flee.Making an escapeIn 2012, John and his friend – the one in the video – paid an agent to fly them to Malaysia. For nearly a year, he worked as a security guard and gave his passport to an agent to get a work permit. The agent was crooked and he never got his passport back. John, now 22, had to leave – again.In 2013, he paid $3,000 to travel to Indonesia, with the ultimate goal of travelling to Australia. After eight months moving from one house to another, an announcement: it was time for their ocean journey.In December 2013, he and 28 people – men, women and children – boarded a boat and began the dangerous journey. The captain was unskilled, and after three days at sea, they nearly capsized. When they arrived in Christmas Island, in the South Pacific, the boat crashed into rocks and they had to swim ashore. “We were in very bad condition and we had not consumed food or water for days. “They thought they were lucky to survive, that the worst was over. It was just beginning.Detention hellDressed in military gear, the men who took them into custody had a surprise up their sleeve. Those who arrived by boat were not going to Australia at all. They were going into detention – locked up in barracks, surrounded by high fences. This was Australia’s new way of dealing with refugees who came by sea. The purpose was to punish the refugees – and to scare off others who might want to come the same way. They would be made an example of.John has been there ever since – trying to stay alive, healthy and sane on one of the world’s  most dangerous sites of refugee detention. The locals see them as unwanted outsiders. People John knows have been robbed, slashed in the body and the face with knives. On most days, he stays inside – despite the excruciating tropical heat -  to stay safe. He remains there, stuck in a horrible limbo. FundingThe good news: we can bring him to Canada, through the private sponsorship program. Since New Zealand’s offer of taking in refugees has been blocked by Australia, and since John has no official refugee status, this is his only way out.A team of volunteers in Toronto has come together to help. Backed by the volunteer network of Ads Up Canada, they have his application and settlement plan in place. The big challenge is funding. The minimum amount required to settle a refugee for one year is set at $16,500, with more preferred, bringing us to our goal of $17,500 in Canadian dollars.  This amount covers the following financial needs, as defined by Canadian immigration:·      Shelter: $7,008·      Food staples: $105·      Startup costs: $3,300·      Household needs: $300·      Furniture: $1,085·      Clothing: $385This seems like a lot, but the financial goal is achievable. Once the money is collected, it will be held in a secure bank account managed by Community Matters Toronto, a registered charity that has agreed to serve as John’s official sponsor. When he arrives, the money gets disbursed under guidelines laid out by the Canadian government. The OpportunityJohn is a smart, sensitive and kind, educated and blessed with great English skills. The volunteers from Australia and Canada who have met John through their outreach efforts feel lucky to know such a smart and motivated young man. He will make a wonderful addition to Canada. This page has been posted by Stephen Watt, a volunteer with Ads Up Canada who is leading the effort to bring John to Canada. You can contact Stephen through Facebook and LinkedIn . Please help!

Dennis Torii ,"Kissimmee, FL",Other,"If America is to survive, it must permanently transform back into its original greatness and expand becoming America 2.0. The way this is going to happen is through Article V of the U.S. Constitution, which is the Convention of States and the willingness through understanding of our Southern neighbors, Canada and Japan, whom we already protect militarily.  The people of Central America and the Caribbean Islands need to be free and they need security.  Canada is no different and they are all vulnerable to Russian and Chinese takeover without question.The need for an answer to this and the problem of America's political civil war has one unifying solution.  We must unite all said territories with the United States using the Convention of States after the border is first sealed for security purposes and staged unification.Using one Convention of States, the U.S. Constitution can be re-set to the original Pre-Progressive Era (pre-1913) Constitution with Originalist updates and expand the nation in accordance with all joining nations to create the New America or America 2.0.Critical analysis on this matter will prove this to not only be correct, but the only survivable path.  Reason must truly be applied now for present and future generations who wish to live free and in peace.The main energy for this revolution is going to come from our Southern neighbors of Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean.  This idea has already been disseminated to all concerned areas and it is only a short matter of time before it erupts like a volcano of change and freedom from the South to be joined by the North and Japan.  Those causing this unstoppable change, that Americans couldn't do on their own, will become the New American Patriot Conservatives by default.  These funds are to initiate this process and quickly organize with primarily Hispanic and Caribbean Organizations, to be followed by Canadian and Japanese ones to form the full blown America 2.0 Revolution Organization. I am the founder but this is going to be in the hands of the people very quickly.  I am asking for $500,000.00  but my needs are little right now and most of that is going right into the non-profit we will be forming. Every penny will be accounted for.  You can search Dennis R. Torii, Jr. and you will see I take up many pages as a public figure with very important patents,  children's books and I was a Libertarian presidential candidate. As this all happens, the New Constitutionalist Party should form and other parties proven corrupt, disbanded.

This energy plays an essential part in healing; it is life’s blood (of ancestral bonds with earth, wind, fire and water) that invigorates well-being. It is something that can be only truly felt when your feet touch ground in your own homeland.Our homeland is the territory of the Woodland Cree, which our ancestor Kuis-Kuis-Kow-Ca-Poohoo deemed to protect under Treaty 8 for the benefit of his people as long as the sun shone and the rivers flowed. Currently, Canada and the Tallcree Tribal Government are colluding to deprive us of our homeland, which is impacting on the physical and spiritual well-being of the people of Tallcree as a whole.Therefore, we as Tallcree Urban Indians, Nehiyowak are working on putting together a case against the TCFN Tribal Government for the following reasons:1. We are TCFN Band Members that rightfully belong to Tallcree;2.

TOS can cause many life-altering symptoms such as intense nerve pain, weakness, blood clots, swelling, numbness and no temperature control in the arms, chest, neck, back and face. The quality of life for those suffering from TOS is profoundly diminished.KaylaLet me introduce you to my wife Kayla: Kayla, at 27, is strong, kind, genuine, caring, funny, and full of love. Kayla will always put her pain and suffering aside to lend a hand to someone in need. Kayla is the friend you want in your corner, the one who will stand up for you, lend you an ear, give you a shoulder to cry on, and take care of you in your time of need. However, being recently diagnosed with ALL three types of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) (Venous, Arterial & Neurogenic), Kayla now needs help from many hands & a lot of support in her corner.  A little history of Kayla, With a complex upbringing, Kayla has never had an easy life. Despite having to grow up fairly young due to uncontrollable circumstances, Kayla always remained stubborn and determined to fight trials of adversity.  Kayla was fully self-supporting at age 15. While she was in high school she had a job, paid for rent, food, and eventually her car when she could afford one. Kayla fought her way through high school and continued to fully support herself through secondary school, where she finally got to fulfill her passion of saving lives as a nurse. Kayla worked on the acute medicine floor at North Bay Regional Hospital, where she dedicated her life to saving lives. As Kayla slowly lost the ability to use her arms, due to the pain and weakness caused by TOS, Kayla still fought to help people. Kayla wasn’t just a lifesaver at work but even in her spare time. Kayla volunteered at a vet clinic, horse rescue, wild at heart, and fostered rescue dogs before they could find their forever homes. In university Kayla tutored in accessibility services, to aid students with hearing or vision impairments. With her compassionate nature, she is the type of person who pulls over at car crashes to make sure people are safe, gets up to let the elderly sit, holds open doors, and will sit and talk to a stranger just because they look lonely. Kayla has the biggest heart and has spent her entire life trying to make the world a better place. It’s almost a cruel joke that, despite Kayla’s hard past,  she is faced with yet another challenge. TOS and its accompanying symptoms of unbearable burning nerve pain and weakness (both arms) have left Kayla in a state where she can’t function or even live her life. With her symptoms getting worse, the burning pain and tingling continues to move up from her arms to her back, chest, neck, and face leaving her unable to complete daily tasks. Such tasks range from: brushing her hair & teeth to being unable to maintain her job which makes this life-saving surgery detrimental. Kayla’s humble personality and selflessness makes asking for help a very big struggle, but with the severity of the condition and the increasing symptoms, she is left with no other choice.Kayla plans to continue to help others through her passion for nursing with the successful completion of this surgery. Dr. Donahue will operate in February (28th) in order to prevent more permanent damage to her nerves & vessels with the chance of giving Kayla full function in her arms again. This will allow Kayla to not only impact the lives of others through nursing but also get her life back to enjoy even the small joys of life (i.e. painting, drawing, writing). Required SurgeryUnfortunately, there are no neurogenic TOS specialists in Canada, there are only surgeons who focus on the artery and veins, but not the nerves. Through extensive research, we have identified a specialist, Dr. Dean Donahue, who operates a Thoracic Outlet Syndrome clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  This is one of the few TOS specialty clinics in the world who focuses on all three types of TOS. Dr. Donahue provides the best chance for Kayla to relieve all of her symptoms, most importantly the nerve pain which causes the most life-altering symptoms. As this clinic is located in the United States, there is no medical coverage available, placing this surgery prohibitively out of reach financially.   Dr. Donahue proposes to perform bilateral first rib resection, pectoralis minor release, neurolysis for the brachial plexus (cleaning the nerves of scar tissue), and the removal of the medial and anterior scalene muscles (neck muscles that compress vasculature and nerves) of the LEFT side first. Then four-six months post-op, he will do the exact same process for the RIGHT side. The first surgical date is February 28, 2020, with hopes of the second surgical date being between July-September 2020, depending on recovery.This solution is the most successful method in treating TOS and is Kayla’s only hope at regaining full function of her arms again to do what she loves best, saving lives. Kayla is courageous, and she has more strength than we can imagine.  Unfortunately, the only barrier now is cost.CostOur Goal is to raise $300,000 (CAN) to cover the required surgeries (2) and to ensure Kayla has funds to enable her to continue treatment at the clinic in Boston. The first surgery date is scheduled for February 28, 2020.- Cost of Surgery and Hospital Stay                                                 $ 260,000- Related Out of Country Costs                                                         $ 5,000- Ongoing Care and subsequent procedures in Boston       $    35,000 You can help Kayla by donating to this campaign through:1.  E-transfer to kaylavstos@outlook.com      or2.  Click the 'Donate' button on this page      or3.

She had to quit her job at the hospital to pick up less physically intense types of work as her pain intensified. Now Kayla’s pain, and weakness is so intense that she is unable to work. She had to give up all of her hobbies of volunteering at various animal clinics, painting, drawing, and writing as she slowly lost the function of her arms. Even everyday tasks like brushing hair, preparing food, and even putting on clothes has become almost impossible due to the pain. History of Kayla’s TOSKayla first noticed her TOS symptoms when she was working at the hospital. She was performing an injection and her hands started to shake and tingle. At first, she thought nothing of it as it might just be lack of sleep or food but as time went on she discovered it was in fact something much worse.As months went on, the symptoms of shaking and tingling intensified and became burning and stabbing nerve pain that radiated down her arms. Frightened, she looked into the source of the pain but was told it was all in her head and she should push through. As doctors came up with no solutions, Kayla was forced to try various conservative remedies just to allow her to work (e.g. chiropractic care, PT, massage, etc.). Kayla’s conservative remedies soon couldn’t keep up with her pain and she was forced to make the hardest decision of her life, find a job that was less painful. Kayla is the toughest and most caring individual I have ever met, leaving the hospital was the hardest decision of her life but she knew she needed to ease up on her body to allow her to find a cure to her pain.Of course, Kayla could never give up her passion of helping people, that’s the thing about Kayla, it doesn’t matter how much pain she is in she will always do what it takes to help someone else. Unable to work full time at the hospital Kayla decided to take a job at the Methadone Clinic and work for VON (community nursing) to help care for individuals in need of the most help. Unfortunately, the pain continued to increase with frequency and intensity and new symptoms started to arise.Kayla, hopeless and trapped in her chronic pain, realized that she couldn’t keep up with the demands of her new jobs. Kayla still had a strong drive to help people but she realized she may have to do it in a different way. Kayla decided to move to Sudbury to go to the university of Laurentian to study psychology with a desire to become a psychiatric nurse. Even during her studies Kayla couldn’t keep away from saving lives and making a difference in her Community. During her studies, she took up part-time work with flexible hours to work around her pain, CBI Home Health (community nursing) and Canadian Blood Services. Unfortunately, intensifying pain and weakness prevented Kayla from typing and writing. Barely able to concentrate from the pain and now unable to write or type, Kayla was forced to drop out and take a 3 year degree. Kayla moved to London where she tried to work in part-time community nursing again but found the pain too terrible. She then decided to work as a nurse at the Canadian Mental Health Association where she aided the homeless community. However, the burning pain and tingling now moved from her chest, back, and arms up in her face. Terrified that she was making her condition worse she realized that she had to do the thing she dreaded most, take a leave of absence from work.Now Kayla desperately waits for surgery at home in constant pain and suffering. Kayla lives in constant anxiety that she is causing irreversible damage, terrified that every action makes her condition worse. That every stroke with a toothbrush is damaging her nerves, arteries, and veins just a little more. She stays strong and fights the pain every single day but every day gets a little bit harder, every day that hope of one day getting better seems to diminished just that little bit more.Dr. Donahue is ready to operate in February, preventing even more detrimental damage to the nerves and vascular system giving Kayla the best chance of regaining the full function of her arms again. The only thing holding Kayla back from getting her arms and going back saving hundreds of lives a year is cost. Please find it in your heart to help out a woman who dedicated her life to saving others. This donation not only helps Kayla but the thousands of people that she will one day save with her healing hands. Help get Kayla’s arms back. A Wife’s Perspective:Kayla is my soul mate and the love of my life. She is the strongest, smartest, funniest, most loving and caring human I have ever met in my entire life. She has been through trials that no one can even imagine with a smile on her face and a hopeful perspective on life. It is heartbreaking to watch such a kind-hearted, strong woman who dedicated her whole life to helping others suffer every day in such pain. It is cruel to watch someone who dedicated her life to working in the Canadian medical system be failed by it.Now I slowly watch the strongest woman I know slip away. I watch the love of my life suffer while it feels like she is being electrocuted, or has her arms, chest, back, and face being burned off. I watch her tremble and grimace in pain every single day, all day long. I watch this, unable to do anything. Nothing eases this pain. No heat or ice packs, no creams, no pills, no massages, nothing touches this pain. Kayla gets to sit in it, knowing there is an answer, knowing that it can all end but we can’t afford it.I am sure that many of you have a significant other, one that you love and cherish just as much as I do for Kayla. Now imagine seeing that person suffer every day. Imagine being powerless to stop any of it. Imagine having an answer but being unable to afford it.Please, help me save my wife. I want to give her everything, I want to start my life with her, I want to build a family with her, I want to live the end of my days with her. I need your help, please help me get my wife’s arms back. Please help me end my wife’s suffering and give her back her life.Here Are A Few photo's Of My Beautiful Wife Before She Became Sick:Here is Kayla’s Diagnostic Journey of TOS: It has been a long and hard fightAttempts at Conservative Care:·      Chiropractic care·      Physiotherapy·      Massage Therapy·      Reiki·      Intramuscular stimulation ·      Active release therapy ·      Acupuncture·      Different types of pain medication (nothing touched it)First family doctoro   Initially told her it was all in her head and she had to work through the pain in order to get better and re-strengthen the muscles (ran and lifted until she was in tears)o   She fought him for MRI’s, blood tests, EMGs, Nerve conduction tests, and X-Rays of her upper and lower body, when he finally gave in he said they were all clear and confirmed his initial diagnosis that it was all in her head.o   When she pleaded with him to keep looking because it was not in her head, he said he refused to order more tests because it would look bad on his license. Leaving her with no hope to look further as every specialist appointment and test must be ordered by a family doctor.o   Later when we switched family doctors and received the reports we realized that the MRI’s suggested a follow up with a neurologist as it may show signs of MS and the EMG specialist said it was not in her head and that there were signs of tarsal tunnel syndrome and other issues in her legs.United States:o   With nowhere to go, we started our journey with a New York spinal surgeon, as the MRI’s show bulging discs along her spine. The surgeon said there was no central nerve compression that was causing Kayla’s intense pain but to look into MS as it might be a cause of her symptoms. He kindly recommended an MS specialist and helped us get an appointment with the clinic the next day.o    The MS Specialist looked at the MRI scans and performed her physical assessment and confirmed it was not MS but still asked us to get another brain MRI in a few months just to confirm her diagnosis (we did with our new family doctor and it came back clear)o   The MS specialist, sympathetic to our journey, continued to help us rule out other options such as B vitamin imbalances, Lyme disease, and various autoimmune disorders. The blood tests came back clear.o   Thinking the nerve pain and weakness must be a peripheral nerve compression instead of nerve degeneration or central nerve compression, we decided to look into a nerve MRI. o   Thanks to a referral from the MS specialist, who continued to help us on our journey, we were able to continue our journey all the way to San Francisco to get our nerve MRI. It was this test that finally pointed us to our answer, TOS.New Family Doctor:o   After our first family doctor confirmed that he was not going to do more tests, we realized we had to switch to get a new perspective on our case.o   Luckily our new family doctor started off well and ordered the follow-up MRI for the MS specialist and a few more blood tests to rule out more autoimmune diseases.o   She sent us to get an EMG and Nerve conduction test at a hand and upper limb clinic to help us confirm the diagnosis of TOS.o   She helped us with our genetic testing application. The application was denied as they said they wanted us to see a rheumatologist, even though all of our markers came back clear. Unfortunately, this caused us issues to convince our new family doctor to refer us to other specialists other than the hand and upper limb and rheumatology. In Canada, if you can’t convince your family doctor to send the referral, there is only one place to go…emergency.Emergency:o   Don’t get me wrong, we had been to multiple ER visits before this moment when new symptoms were arising, such as chest pain, weakness in arms, intense burning pain down the arms, and tingling crawling up the neck and into the face. All of the emergency doctors claimed none of this was considered an emergency and to quote one of the doctors “…was a waste of emergency resources”.o   X- Rays of cervical ribs to see if that was causing the compression on the nerveso   Begged the doctor to send our referral to one of two surgeons that deal with vascular TOS. Luckily, he took pity on our case and sent our documents to the vascular surgeon.Hand and Upper Limb Clinic:o   Completed the nerve conduction tests and EMGs, came back clear (which is a good thing as it means the nerves are not fully damaged yet and can still be saved with quick action).o   Performed a nerve block in the chest and neck to freeze the brachial plexus nerve. Luckily it took the pain away for the two hours it stayed in the system. A positive sign for TOS as it shows the brachial plexus nerve is causing the painVascular Surgeon:o   Finally, we got to see someone who specializes in vascular TOS. After doing his vascular ultrasound and CTA he confirmed that the bilateral compression between Kayla’s first rib and collar bone was so bad that it not only compressed the nerve but also the artery and the vein running down to both of her arms. This was the first doctor to officially confirm that Kayla suffers from all three types of TOS.o   For the first time in a long time we were ecstatic, a doctor finally gave us an answer and didn’t say it was all in Kayla’s head.o   Unfortunately, this is where our excitement ended as this surgeon made it very clear that he is a vascular surgeon. He didn’t believe in neurogenic TOS thus he doesn’t do pectoralis minor releases as he was only focusing on the artery and the vein compression. o   Now we panicked, the burning nerve pain that sends lightning bolts down Kayla’s arms and makes them so weak that she can barely use them is the main reason we need the surgery.o   This is where we realized that we need to find a surgeon that believes in neurogenic as well as vascular TOS.o   Unfortunately, through extensive research we found that there are NO NTOS specialists in Canada and no one who would agree to do the pectoralis minor release.o   With no one in Canada to help, there was only one place to look, the United States.Dr. Dean Donahue; United States Neurogenic, Arterial, and Venous TOS specialisto   This is where we found Dr. Dean Donahue, who operates a Thoracic Outlet Syndrome clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  This is one of the few TOS specialty clinics in the world.o   This surgeon does it all, he will remove the first rib, the medial and arterial scalene muscles, he will grind/remove the cervical ribs if they are too big, he will perform the pectoralis minor release, and he focuses on the neurolysis to get the best results to take away the nerve pain.o   This surgeon is Kayla’s best chance at recovering because the fewest amounts of surgeries cause the least amount of trauma to the nerves. This surgeon is Kayla’s dream come true.o   Here we are, finally an answer to the years of unexplained pain in Kayla’s arms. Finally an answer to what has made it impossible for Kayla to work, steal all of her hobbies, and made it impossible to perform any tasks with her arms. Finally, a surgeon to fix Kayla’s pain and get her back to doing what she loves and living her life.o   It seems to be a cruel trick that the only thing holding Kayla back is money.o   This is where we need people like you. People that can spare even a few dollars to help a loving, caring, funny, kind, hard-working woman get back to doing what she loves most, saving lives. Kayla longs for the day that she can go back to work at the hospital, where she gets the opportunity to impact thousands of lives a year and heal them on their difficult journey through the medical system.Thank you for taking the time to read my wife's story. We appreciate any help you are willing to give us. ","January 9, 2020","$17,332","$300,000 "
Lindsay Shepherd ,"Waterloo, ON",Education & Learning,"The Laurier Society for Open Inquiry, which was founded in January 2018 by Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU) graduate student Lindsay Shepherd, has over 180 members and has held numerous successful events in the Waterloo region in Ontario. LSOI hosts speakers from across the political spectrum. Some of our previous speakers include: -      James Kitchen, lawyer with the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms -      David Clement, libertarian and North American Affairs Manager with Consumer Choice Center-      Faith Goldy, former commentator with Rebel Media (note: this event was cancelled by a protestor pulling the fire alarm and never proceeded)-      Dr. Frances Widdowson, Marxist-socialist and associate professor at Mount Royal University, Calgary-      Andrew Lawton, writer and former candidate for the Ontario Progressive Conservatives LSOI’s next event is set to be Wed. October 24th, 7pm-8:30pm, on the Wilfrid Laurier University campus. The topic is “Does Trans Activism Negatively Impact Women’s Rights?”, and the presenter is the founder and editor of Feminist Current, Meghan E. Murphy. Feminist Current is Canada’s leading feminist website.  However, to host this talk about women’s rights, which will be presented by a left-leaning feminist, Wilfrid Laurier University is charging the Laurier Society for Open Inquiry $8,055 CAD. Yes, that’s right, $8,055 to discuss human rights and feminism on a university campus. Many try to frame the free speech on campus debate as a left vs. right or liberal vs. conservative issue, but this is simply not the case. Wilfrid Laurier University charged LSOI $5,331 to host leftist professor Frances Widdowson back in May 2018, which LSOI was able to successfully crowdfund through GoFundMe in 24 hours (thank you to all you wonderful and generous people who donated from all across the world!). Now, WLU has upped the ante, and are charging $8,055 for LSOI to host a leftist feminist writer who has an M.A. in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies. We won't let them intimidate and stifle us. The university charges LSOI excessive fees because they want us to have to pay for others’ ability to protest. The university is saying that LSOI, a group genuinely interested in hearing ideas from across the political spectrum, must use our own funds to pay for others to threaten our event! It is simply unjust.  When Wilfrid Laurier University has been previously confronted about their censorious security fees, they often try to diverge from the issue by pointing out that LSOI is not an “official” student group. This is true, but not because LSOI was denied by the student union or anything like that. At WLU, only undergraduate students can be executives and members of official student clubs. Graduate students do not have their own clubs, and they cannot hold positions within undergraduate clubs. Due to this bureaucratic overlook on WLU's part, and seeing as LSOI President Lindsay Shepherd and many other members are graduate students, we could not apply for official club status. However, we are obviously deeply rooted in the Laurier community – that is the school we formed out of.  Charging a student-based group $8,055 to host a talk about women’s rights is morally reprehensible and unprincipled. We would be so thankful if you can contribute anything to help us pay this $8,055 ransom. LSOI strongly believes we need to keep the spirit of free speech and open inquiry alive in our universities, and radical protestors should NOT be allowed to shut down politically incorrect views through their threats and violence. Unfortunately, universities enable these protestors, and we must do everything we can to succeed despite the obstacles they put us through. Thank you so much. Without your support, Wilfrid Laurier University would succeed in stifling open inquiry.","October 6, 2018","$2,862","$8,055 "
Joel Bochi Villaruel ,"Chicago, IL",Other,"Hello family and friends, I write this long and extended statement today to inform you all of what is currently going on in my life. My mother was recently detained due to a felony she had commited back in 1999. Since she is immigrant and came to the states under a visa, she tried to rebuild her life here in Chicago for her children back in 1991. She had her dreams accomplished by performing in a surplus amount of venues singing. She was prestigous back in the Philippines and known to be a fantastic writer. Today, she remains to be the foundation of our family who continously works hard to maintain food on our plates and a roof above our heads. As a single parent, she worked the 9-5 shifts and beyond just to make ends meet. After her conviction, she went through the process spending 1 full year in rehab and house arrest under a convict program called Sheriffs Female Furlough Program, which allows participants to leave jail under electrical monitoring. Since her case, from 17 years ago, she has been travelling in and out of the country a total of 5 times, all just to spend some vacation time with her family and friends. One trip to Canada, one in spain, and three in the Philippines. In 2014, she was on her way back from the Philppines until she was flagged and detained in the City of Guam. She was held there for about 10 hours until she was allowed to come back into the U.S. From there, she was required to visit the Immigration Services building to be informed that might be facing deportation. From March 2014 till May 2016, we've been going back and forth, bringing documents left and right required for her case. Until early May, she made her last trip and was therefore detained yet again. On May 5th, 2:30PM, my mother had called me to tell me that she was going to be detained and I was required to be in Downtown by 3PM to bond her out. An officer had called me right after, since my mother was too distraught to talk, informing me that I needed to be there as soon as possible before she is required to be detained at Woodstock, Illinois. It was impossible for me to arrive in Downtown in a matter of 5 minutes or even have the bond minimum to bail her out. As of current, we have been working with an immigration lawyer who has referred us to another lawyer that handles immigration PCR (Post Conviction Relief) and a pardon, which allows her to stay within the states till her case gets settled. to help us get her out as soon as possible. Which is why I am asking for anyone's help at this point. The system already seems unjust in this situation, but I was told that by an officer that was informing me about mother's case, ""There's a million people that enter in and out of the state, so there's only so many people we can track down."" My mom has been raising two young boys as a single parent, filed our taxes, paying for our education, and most of all being hardest working mother that none can compare too. Our family has been through hard times, but my mother has always been there to support my younger brother and I. It fills me with shame to write this out and explain my personal life to anyone reading this as I am more conservative on such matters. But in these desperate times, I am seeking for anyone's help... We are looking to raise at least $5,000 dollars since it is the standard fee for the pardon. I am employed now soon to be 4 jobs. Part time manager at a gym, teaching kids breakdancing, performer, and soon a concierge for an apartment complex. My brother is currently going to college, starting his 2nd year at UIC (University of Illinois in Chicago). Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you consider in helping my cause.

Koe Creation ,"San Francisco, CA","Creative Arts, Music & Film","Who I AmMy name is Koe Creation, sex educator for the 21st Century! I grew up as a child of a sex-positive, polyamorous family, and I use my unique knowledge as a second-generation queerspawn to provide prospective parents & families a framework for successful cross-generational communication about their identities and relationship(s). My expertise in this field comes from the literal lifetime of hands-on training in nonviolent communication, intentional relationship building and sex-positive parenting, from the child’s perspective through adulthood. I have taken that wisdom and combined it with a decade of teaching comprehensive sex-education and non-profit case management to help those seeking support in exploration and tools for resiliency.  The Purpose:On March 29, 2019, my first book is being published by Thorntree Press. “I wish you raised-polyamorous kids didn’t have toteach polyamory 101 to so many adults.” –JeanAs the ideas of non-monogamy gain more legitimacy in modern, western society; the question “what of the children?” comes up with frequency. This book is a resource I have seen the non-monogamous world needing and I used the power of my personal experience to highlight one story where the child turned out alright. In my work,  I aim to be a resource for the children of non-monogamous families who might be experiencing the bullying, stereotyping and confusion that I did growing up in the face a society that largely doesn’t understand you and your family. I was blessed with a deeply caring tribe who taught me the power of self awareness, compassionate communication and resilience; It’s now time for me to share the wisdom they showed me with prospective and current sex-positive, non-monogamous parents and those looking to work in allyship with them!I am already scheduled for a book signing and talk at Southwest Love Fest the weekend of March 28-31, as it coincides with the release date. My plan is to from there continue on a mutli-city book tour, bringing myself and my book to poly communities across the U.S. and Canada (and hopefully beyond!). My hope is for each stop to be more than a standard book signing, but an interactive community experience. I have already begun reaching out, planning, and booking events, but I can’t do this (or get to these locations) all alone. The Ask:Friends, family, community and extended tribe - to bring this book to the communities that it would most benefit, I need your help. If you believe in the work that I do, and have the ability to give, please do. No donation is too small, and every cent will help bring myself and the book tour to one more location. Whether you donate or not, I also humbly ask you to share, signal boost, and spread the word far and wide. Goals:The initial goal of $10,000 will support traveling to all the US and Canadian cities currently on my wishlist. However, every little bit will help get me to one more city! I’ll update here and on Facebook as additional cities and stops are booked and funded. For every $2000 we reach, I will add content such as bonus stories, videos, and other fun bits!Funds raised will go directly to costs for travel (flights, trains, places to stay) and tour costs (venue & event fees as needed). About The Book:Order the paperback (or Kindle edition) via presale on Amazon Many of us were asked by our mother to do the dishes as children. Perhaps some of us would need to be asked more than once. Koe Creation was the type who’d get asked three times, by three different mothers. Crowded parent-teacher conferences, queer youth summer camp, and parental adoptions over potluck dinner were typical of Koe’s upbringing in a queer, polyamorous family. Taught from young age to embrace sex-positivity and LGBT acceptance, Koe had an experience of “family values” that differs wildly from many raised in conservative North America. Still: all families know conflict and all hearts know struggle, no matter how loved. Though a poster child for the alternative Seattle community, Koe yearned for a realization of theirself beyond the “shadow of their tribe.” This drive for a singular identity led Koe to leave the alt-Seattle scene to find the self that no one person or family could make for them. This Heart Holds Many is a testament of transformative, communal love, as told by an educator and life-long learner who has dedicated their life to helping others grasp their extraordinary love.Advance reviews and critical praise for the book:“Koe Creation’s delightful book This Heart Holds Many is perfect for anyone who has wondered how polyamorous families affect children, parents, and those Koe calls ‘parent adjacent.’ In a rare peek into the life of a ‘polykid’ raised by five parents, Koe offers anecdotes from their life with a polytribe. From the pregnant lady sandwich to the chaotic (mis)adventures of young love or the trials and triumphs of adulting, Koe guides readers through the life of a second-generation polyamorous person with charming candor.”— Elisabeth Sheff, author of The Polyamorists Next Door and When Someone You Love is Polyamorous and editor of Stories from the Polycule “This autobiography of a young adult raised in a pagan, polyamorous extended family is full of information for parents and kids of all backgrounds. Useful ideas abound and lead the reader to question the traditional wisdom of our society.” — David S. Hall, founding editor, Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality “Imagine that a big tribal family from the 22nd century falls into our time and lands in Seattle, where they have to keep partly hidden from the normals. You’re born into it and grow up through a rollicking kidhood, a moody, rebellious adolescence, then young-adult questing and brilliant maturity. All the while you hide your three moms and two dads from forces in the ‘overculture’ that may threaten them—while you become an ambassador from the 22nd century to many others. This fast-paced memoir grabs you like a piece of Heinlein’s science fiction, while serving as a guide, a warning, an encouragement, and a wise teaching tool for families of every kind.” — Alan MacRobert, Polyamory in the News“The question I get a lot as a polyamorous parent is ‘But what about the children?’ Having a firsthand account by someone who lived and loved and learned in a polyamorous household is invaluable to any of us who raise children in the same environment. Bravo!” — Kevin A. Patterson, curator of Poly Role Models and author of Love's Not Color Blind and the For Hire series","March 1, 2019","$1,726","$5,000 "

We were inside our apartment when it was torn apart; our lives were saved by clinging on to a mattress with all our strength for two hours. Most of our personal effects - including clothes and laptop computer - were swept away as the 200mph winds tore off doors and windows and gutted our apartment. Our car was crushed as it was blown down the hill. There was widespread looting, lack of food and water, and no communications.The financial blow to us has been devastating! Hurricane Irma has destroyed our finances and our retirement plans. The loss of our two stores was an end to our income, and at 67 years of age we are now unemployed. Our net loss of income is over US$80,000 (£57,000).Our ""Elements"" Front Street store (pink, on the right)Back view, flooded by the storm surgeOur Old Street ""Elements"" store hidden by debrisInterior damage to Old Street ""Elements""RETIREMENT PLAN DESTROYEDFrom March 2014 we were employed as store managers of ""Elements of St. Maarten"" - our five year plan was to earn the money to buy a home, and to save enough to survive retirement. We wanted to live on the water, and we found a boat we could afford in Europe. We purchased her in September 2016, three years before our planned retirement. We now had our floating home, and all was going to plan, until the hurricane hit us on 6th September 2017!With our plans ruined this loss of income is a life-changer. Our boat is our only home - we have nowhere else to live.EVACUATIONAfter the hurricane there was very little left standing in St. Marten, and we were fortunate enough to leave the island on an evacuation flight to Aruba, and from there to Bonaire, where Grace became very ill. No doubt her resistance was low after our recent experience. She picked up a virus that left her very weak and knocked her on her back for weeks. We had to pay doctors' bills. Both of us lost a lot of weight.Thanks to the goodwill and kindness of extremely generous people, we stayed in Bonaire until the end of April 2018.OUR APPEAL: HELP US SAVE OUR HOME!We are now back in Europe. What money we have left is fast diminishing, and we are struggling to complete repairs to our floating home. We now have insufficient funds to sustain us through retirement. Rob's pension is minimal, and as Grace is living abroad Canada Pension pays her next-to-nothing.We realise our only hope of surviving this misfortune is by swallowing our pride and asking for financial help. We need to raise enough money for essential equipment and to complete repairs, otherwise we cannot get our boat - our home - out of the boatyard and back into the water. We cannot stay in the boatyard as we cannot afford the fees!Our immediate goal is to raise the money to enable us to complete the work on ""Azzurra"" - our home - and to meet essential costs (such as insurance and safety equipment). Our contract with the boatyard is paid up to mid September, so our deadline is 31st August. In the longer term, we hope to raise additional funds to enable us to survive retirement for ten years.OUR GOAL:£10,000. Immediate goal to save our houseboat. Deadline 31 August 2018.£12,000. Longer term to help survive retirement for ten years, including boat maintenance and running costs.TOTAL: £22,000Please help us if you can, for even the smallest donation will make a huge difference!

Thank you!KINDNESS FROM STRANGERS!In Bonaire, a lady we had never met let us stay in her beautiful waterside apartment; we were completely humbled by her kindness! She is now a friend, and we shall forever be in her debt. Two kind couples gave us the use of their bicycles so we could get around town and carry groceries. One man mentioned our story to a lady he met in church, then gave us a $100 bill, which she had donated to us. It was these gestures that made us realise that appealing for help was not such an embarrassing thing after all, as kind people are often ready to help those in need. Without any request, help was being offered to us by caring, compassionate people, who were glad to do it.Our neighbours in St. Maarten - under extremely difficult conditions - ensured that we were supplied with food and water until we were able to leave the island, and one ran his vehicle on empty to ensure we got to the airport. Dutch marines and paratroopers were overseeing the evacuation of hundreds of people at the airport; one of them was especially kind to us, and collected food rations from his unit so we didn't go hungry while standing in line for twelve hours in the airport car park.From Florida, a lovely couple who were regular customers in our ""Elements of St. Maarten"" stores, without any request from us, sent us a donation as soon as they saw news of the hurricane on TV. We were of course embarrassed to accept charity, but we soon realised these are lovely, generous people who sincerely want to help, and there are many like them who feel the same.Sincerest thanks to you all for your kindness!(Happier days on Sint Maarten)","April 25, 2018","£1,782","£22,000 "
Eva Spudich ,"Fort Worth, TX",Education & Learning,"Alex has had an amazing year. At the beginning of the school year, we were notified that she had been nominated by one of her teachers to be a Student Ambassador and travel to Canada next summer to study. She did a great job in her interview and when they called us to give us the results, they told us that they felt that she was going to be a great asset to their Delegation. We are so very proud of her! The Certificate of Acceptance sent to her from the Student Ambassador Program states, ""Acceptance has been bestowed based on a demonstration of leadership and citizenship, a desire to learn about diverse cultures, and a willingness to venture into the world in the name of peace, friendship and understanding.""While in Canada, Alex will get to study many things which are of interest to her. She is most excited about getting to go out on the boats and study pods of Killer Whales with a Marine Biologist and learn about tracking and sonar. She will get to learn about wolf conservation and visit one of the wildlife refuges set up for that purpose. She will also get to travel to Parliament and learn about the government in Canada in contrast to ours. While in Canada, she will get to stay with a First Nation Tribe and eat traditional foods and stay in traditional housing. She will also  get a behind the scenes look at the world's largest dinosaur museum and interact with the lecturing paleontologists on staff at the museum. She was told to bring an empty water bottle to sample some of the purest water in the world when she actually goes out on the glaciers to study them as part of the Earth Stewards Program. She has been given her assignments to work on to earn credit for her studies abroad. Alex has many interests in world cultures and always wants to learn from them. Alex is also very interested in animals and has already informed me which college she would like to attend to help her reach her goals. She recognizes that this opportunity is very special and feels very fortunate to be given the chance to accomplish some of her goals and spread her wings.   She is very excited, anxious and humble, stating that she couldn't believe her teachers nominated her. This opportunity truly offers her so much, in so many areas of interest to her. She is an intelligent, level headed and good-hearted person by nature. She is always concerned for others and wants to help make things better in this world of ours. She has a way of making those around her want to be better people too. She is truly a blessing, and we couldn't possibly be more proud of the young lady she has become. Now the fun begins... We have to find a way to fund this trip. We are asking for assistance to send her on this journey. Every donation will help us to make this a reality for her.","November 19, 2014","$4,050","$5,000 "
