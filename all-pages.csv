Quiggin Report` ,"East York, ON",Other,"Operation: Kill Switch asks why a federally registered taxpayer subsidized charitable organization, with alleged links to extremism, still has charitable status?   Why does the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and many of his caucus members have such strong ties to these types of organizations? Military veteran and intelligence expert, Tom Quiggin, has been sharing technical intelligence analysis on this issue and is now targeted in a frivolous multi-million-dollar lawfare lawsuit to try to silence him. Should taxpayer-funded charities be allowed to target our military veterans with your money? -> Help us protect this military veteran who continues to fight to keep our society (and us) safe from growing extremism.-> Help us expose these organizations and their members for their alleged nefarious connections to extremism by supporting our campaign now.Speak up and act while you still can. Your donations and support will help us fight back.BACKGROUNDLast year, Tom Quiggin, an ex-military intelligence and counter-terrorism expert launched a podcast to share his 30 years of experience in intelligence gathering and analysis on the current threats our society is facing.Tom Quiggin is a court qualified expert on terrorism (criminal court and Federal Court) and “intelligence collection and evidence” (Federal Court). Tom has testified on multiple occasions to Senate and the House of Commons Committees as well as a Royal Commission (Air India Inquiry 2007). He has also provided testimony to the Special Senate Committee on Anti-terrorism (2010).  A former Senior Fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he has 30 plus years of practical intelligence experience in a variety of positions including the: - Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Bank of Canada, - Canadian Armed Forces- United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia- Citizenship and Immigration Canada (War Crimes) - International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (The Hague)- Privy Council Office of Canada. - Arms control inspector for the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the Vienna Document. For the past several years Tom Quiggin has been researching the growth of extremism in western nations engaged in a well financed campaign of entryism, fueled by numerous front groups tracing back to the The Muslim Brotherhood Islamist Terrorist network.  Due to the vast amounts of financial support from foreign actors, mainstream media often refuses to report on these and related topics. They fear reprisal or being targeted by lawfare / harassment lawsuits, designed exclusively to cause ongoing financial damages through exorbitant legal fees charged to any defendant. This is the tactic being used now against Tom Quiggin, Raheel Raza of Muslims Facing Tomorrow, and Tahir Gora (co-authors of the book Submission) for filing an official complaint to Canada’s federal police and intelligence agency, The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Canadian Security and Intelligence Agency (CSIS) is also believe to be surveilling similar operations.  In 2015 a federally registered organization was identified as a Muslim Brotherhood front group in Senate Testimony in Canada. Since then, Tom Quiggin has been exposing the facts of its relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas both listed terrorist organizations by a variety of foreign military and  intelligence agencies. This organization has now launched a retaliatory multi-million dollar lawfare harassment lawsuit accusing Tom Quiggin and six other entities of allegedly running a “campaign of defamation”. Although many of the documents sighted in the RCMP complaint are Government of Canada sources, the organization has decided that these are irrelevant and is desperately trying to keep Tom Quiggin’s body of work on this topic hidden from public consumption.   This is an aggressive scare tactic aiming to force us to abandon our platforms, to censor documented facts and obfuscate the responsibility of the actors involved.We will not back down. They have made this a public legal battle where our irrefutable evidence will expose them to public scrutiny. But we desperately need your support. Operation: Kill Switch is how we do this. We need your help to bring the evidence to trial and take this organization down, so if you support this cause, please help us by contributing to the campaign today.OPERATION: KILL SWITCH The federally registered charity, Islamic Relief Canada, is politically connected to the Liberal Party of Canada, influential in terms of policy and directly linked to Islamic Relief Worldwide. (Islamic Relief Worldwide has been listed as a terrorist funding operation by The United Arab Emirates). Much of our evidence has been provided by government documents and or Islamic Relief Canada’s own documentation, but winning the case and pushing back at this  organizations aggressive bullying tactic, cannot be taken lightly. They have considerable financial resources and support from numerous other powerful organizations. In addition, since the Trudeau government was elected, the organisation in question, are now receiving funding directly from the government of Canada to combat “islamophobia”. This will become relevant at a later date. To document and prove the connections, and to follow the money trail, requires a lot of preparation, an organized and strategic response, and financial resources. This is Operation: Kill Switch - A coordinated effort to defend our rights and freedoms, to question and debate the activities of this group and others like it, and deter them from accessing taxpayer money to finance extremist activities abroad.If you believe in this cause as much as we do, please help us and donate to the campaign now.PREPARATION HAS BEGUNThe victims being targeted in this harassment suit have sought legal council to assess the campaign against them.  Based on initial consultations and research, we have started taking action to prepare our response and a statement of defence - a public document highlighting much of our evidence, which has now been filed with the superior court.  Operation Kill Switch is already very much underway:- A team of researchers with expertise in analysis, from various countries and backgrounds, is collecting more and more evidence- Tom Quiggin is working with other specialists in his network, to build on the evidence in the initial statement of defence and ensure the are filed, and on the public record.- Council retained by Tom Quiggin are experienced in the field of defamation and lawfare suits targeting individuals(What is lawfare? Lawfare is a form of war consisting of the use of the legal system against an enemy, such as by damaging or delegitimizing them, tying up their time or winning a public relations victory. The term is a portmanteau of the words law and warfare.  Lawfare is the use or misuse of the law to silence critics or drive them into submission rather than using other means such as civil discourse or discussion. Islamist groups in North America regularly use well-funded lawfare cases to silence or frighten those who expose their extremist beliefs.)- Community groups and leaders have been contacted to address questions about nefarious entities working within the plaintiff organization, allegedly making statements that could be considered hate speech.  For example, Fathima Bahatta executive member of Islamic Relief has been recorded making statements like “the Jews are the enemies of Islam” and long live the antifada [Holly war against Jews.] We have requested an investigation into hate speech comments demanding her resignation.- Operation Kill Switch will also lead a parallel investigation and inquiry asking how an organization with potentially questionable and/or indirect ties to extremism could still be a federally registered charity under Canadian and international law.- Aid concerned advocacy groups working to fight against extremism, hate speech and groups fighting anti-semitism, to highlight such egregious views and demand the immediate resignation of these individuals. WHO IS INVOLVED?The following people are targeted in the proceedings:TOM QUIGGIN Tom Quiggin is a federal and criminal court-qualified terrorism expert whose expertise on the “the reliability of intelligence as evidence” has been recognized by the Federal and Criminal Court of Canada, where his testimony has been entered as evidence on multiple occasions. Quiggin has conducted ground-breaking work to expose facts that are extremely important not only to Canadians but to the international community, as we deal with a global Islamist insurgency which few people are brave enough to address in public forums for fear of targeting by extremists aligned with the islamist cause. This body of evidence is opening avenues for major discussion and debate desperately needed in our society consumed by political correctness, politicking, and the shameful rise of the muzzling of freedom of speech under the banner of Islamophobia. There are opinions and there are facts; Quiggin does not engage in uninformed speculation. There is at least one group, however, attempting to use a tactic called libel chill, using our very own legal system against us, to silence voices like Tom Quiggin purporting that he has used opinion to run a “campaign of defamation”. Quiggin’s expertise has not gone unnoticed and throughout his career, he has been called upon by numerous government entities and specialist organizations to offer his expert advice to their leaders. Today Tom hosts his own podcast to share his intelligence insight with a wider audience, and has a regular spot on National Post Radio and Sirius XM, in his weekly talk with Anthony Fury, host of Canada Talks (channel 167).  Tom is also a frequent guest on syndicated radio programs such as The Roy Green Show with veteran journalist Roy Green, Charles Adler Tonight, Global News Radio with Award Winning Journalist Alex Pierson, Former political leader turned radio journalist Danielle Smith, and numerous alternative media sources, YouTube Channels, podcasts and other forums. RAHEEL RAZARaheel Raza is a member of the Clarion Project Advisory Board and President of the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow. She is an award-winning journalist, author, public speaker, media consultant, anti-racism activist, and interfaith discussion leader. She is the author of, Their Jihad, Not My Jihad: A Muslim Canadian Woman Speaks Out.A constant presence on television, she has appeared as a regular panellist on Jane Hawtin Live, Michael Coren, Ben Mergui Live, Vision, CBC, CTV, City TV, TVO, Faith Journal and Behind the Line on CTS, OMNI as well as on CBC and CFRB radio. In a presentation to Members of Parliament and international diplomats at the House of Commons in Canada, Raza received a standing ovation for her speech called, “Celebrating our Differences.”Raheel has received many awards for her work building bridges of understanding, including the City of Toronto’s Constance Hamilton award for working towards the equitable treatment of women. She also received the Senate of Canada 150 medal in honour of her advocacy. Senator Frum, speaking at the ceremony, cited Raza’s commitment to liberty and equity and thanked her for “relentless advocacy for human rights, particularly the rights of vulnerable girls and women living under Sharia law”.In June 2006, Raheel was invited to meet Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada following which she also had the honour to meet with Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada. Yet, in subsequent years, Canadian leaders have been less honouring of her accomplishments. While politicians are glad to pose for photo ops with more radical voices, Raza said, “a Muslim woman who has been warning about the dangers of radicalization encroaching on the corridors of every institution in this country is kept away like a pariah.”TAHIR GORAGora is a prominent novelist, poet, journalist, editor, translator and publisher with over 30 years of experience in the industry. Recognized as a bold social activist who has initiated many interfaith and pluralistic streams to bring the Muslim community of Canada together to support progressive ideas and actions.He is a strong proponent of freedom of speech and has developed various initiatives to bring about the much-needed changes in the representational and communal aspects of the Canadian Muslim Community. Gora was active in several literary, cultural and political organizations in Pakistan and was a noted critic of religious intolerance in that country. He is a columnist for the Huffington Post, founder of ‘Canadian Thinkers’ Forum’, ‘Progressive Muslims Institute Canada’ and ‘Muslim Committee Against Antisemitism. He is also a recipient of the Queen Diamond Jubilee Medal for his services in Canada.HELP US FIGHT BACKThe suppression of speech and “m103”, the so-called Islamophobia motion, have already gone too far. We must prevent groups with Islamist ideologies and aspirations antithetical to westphalian liberal democratic values from spreading intolerance into our political systems. Extremist groups or those indirectly supporting extremist activities must be cut off from access to taxpayer funding.Please support Operation: Kill Switch to help put a full-stop on political Islamist entryism.

Allen Toma ,"Thornhill, ON",Non-Profits & Charities,"Heart in Hand: Ramsn's Wish... If you are reading this then it means that you know me, Allen Toma, either personally or through a friend, then you'll know.... or you can easily find out that I've lived my life by one important statement:   ""It is more fulfilling to give then to receive"". However even for myself it is not always easy to give because there are so many out there that take advantage of people’s genuine good will or dilute the intentions of good will. However, I believe that in all our hearts, all of us crave the need to pick each other up when we need a hand, when we see someone down and out, if you search your soul deep enough there will be a voice urging you to extend your hand.... ""Our souls crave it, our heart begs us do it, our hands are wide open and our minds make sense of it but fear stops us.... "" Let me help you eliminate the fear to place your heart in your hands and help the way your soul craves it: I want to tell you a story of a courageous, inspiring selfless, brave man named Ramsn Al Bazi. Ramsn is a Canadian Citizen of Chaldean Iraqi decent, he immigrated to Canada in 2009 and he lived in Toronto for 5 years and 5 months and is an active contributing volunteer to the Good Shepard Chaldean Catholic Church in Toronto, Ontario. Like many immigrants lucky enough to have the opportunity to find his way to this country, his first instincts were to rescue his family left behind in Iraq from the turmoil of years of war, and persecution of faith.   As the story goes and as many immigrants new to this country soon realize the process of bringing loved ones to Canada from war torn countries like Iraq is an arduous and bureaucratic process, but with his heart in his hands Ramsn was sucessfully reunited with his family in Woodbridge, Ontario in 2015. But Ramsn's story doesn't stop there. In 2015 Ramsn decided to leave everything he fought so hard to to gain in Canada, including his family, in order to move back to Iraq. The stories and pictures that funneled in of the thousands and thousands of displaced families, elderly grandparents, children mentally and physically challenged became too much for Ramsn to bear.  If you ever have the opportunity to speak to Ramsn you will hear a voice of love, compassion and determination, but his voice quickly weakens when you ask him about the children that have had to endure the pain that no child should ever have to be exposed to.  The sheer pain of what he sees now in front of him everyday pulls at his heart, and brings a grown man to uncontrollable tears.... Ahead of his own safety and well being, Ramsn took it upon himself to start his own solitary mission to help in Iraq. “....after praying to God, on December 29th I left Canada to Iraq to help and protect my beautiful people and always knew God was with me. I loved Canada because I’m a citizen of Canada and part of the Canadian family, as I love Iraq because it is my everything in life...” - Ramsn Al Bazi His mission was to help the same people he shared his life with when he was still in Iraq; People he broke bread with, People who attended church with him on Sundays,People he waved to in passing, People he celebrated with in the community, People he held the door open for at work,  People he sent holiday cards and congratulations to,People he bought gifts for,  Children he watched innocently play in the streets from a more simple and safe time.....  The exact same people you and I cross paths with every single day here in our own lives....   The difference is, these people that Ramsn has volunteered himself selflessly to help, have been forced out of the houses they once called home.... their churches torn down, their faith broken,  No more Christmas, No more birthdays, No more children playing and feeling safe, No doctors, No money, No help..... Just loneliness and desperation... Just take a second to let that sink in....imagine the life you live, the things you get to enjoy, the safety you feel, the happiness you are blessed with, then imagine all of it being taken away without a choice, in an instant..... from your neighbor, from your friends, from your family, and from your very own children. But this isn't a story of just sadness, it is a story of triumph over adversity, a story of compassion, a story of selflessness, a story of success, a story of victory against all odds!!..... Because of the courageous efforts of Ramsn he was able to raise enough support to buy some of these desperate children, basic necessities like wheel chairs so they can move around their refugee camps like everyone else, instead of laying on the floors paralyzed by their condition, unable to move. Here are some pictures that tell stories of these beautiful children that have been touched by Ramsn’s compassion: Soleen: Girl (green pants and white shirt) Condition: Brain paralysisEmad -  Boy (yellow shirt) Condition: QuadriplegicRenas - Boy (holding the walker wearing purple)Condition: Broken Back requires operationYousef - Boy (wearing brown holding toy animal) Both his parents were taken Dalen - Girl (wearing blue and white) Condition: Rare disease of the eye, requires operation costing more than $5000 or she may loose her sight.We were able to help these children, with just some community faith here in Toronto, some local friends getting together to donate whatever was comfortable for them. But just imagine what we can do for these families and children with just a little more faith to put your heart in your hands. Just a little more faith that your each and every dollar is going directly into the hands of these people in the form of heath care, food, and basic necessities that every human being today should have the right to have. No big infrastructure, no big charity, no waste.....every single dollar will change lives. If you have taken the time to read this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your time.If you find it in yourself to donate I hope that you can feel the joy and fulfillment of knowing that you made a difference.If you are still unsure, there is no pressure... but all I ask is that you search your soul for that voice that urges you to be the one that makes a difference. “...... If it is God’s will I will never give up, because I have faith there are still nice people who have their hearts filled with Gods love”.... - Ramsn Al Bazi Check back here for updates on Ramsn's mission in the coming months to see how your support is helping, and please pass this along, if you do anything at all please pass this along.....","January 2, 2016","$1,970","$10,000 "
Terry Christenson ,"Carling, ON",Volunteer & Service,"PLEASE HELP 71-YEAR-OLD ""PROTESTING GRANDPA"" TERRY CHRISTENSON WITH HIS LEGAL EXPENSES! Terry was arrested July 10 while attempting his third protest against the Trans Mountain Pipeline since 2018.  As of July 15, Terry has been in jail for 5 days, after refusing bail and denying legal representation on stated moral and ethical grounds. His next plea hearing is on July 22 in BC Superior Court in Vancouver. --Terry's bio:My name is Terry Christenson. I’m a 71 year old musician/climber/activist who has been a member of Greenpeace since 2006.In 2013 I was one of the first Arctic 30 to take action in Russian territory (Prirazlomnaya platform). In April 2018 I decided to act alone to take action against Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline in Burnaby B.C. I climbed the largest cottonwood within their boundary fence and defied a superior court injunction along with many others that day including Green Party leader Elizabeth May and Greenpeace elder Rex Weyler.As a result of this action I spent the night in Deer Lake RCMP detachment. Those police officers I encountered were absolutely first class people. Being a rope access person I’ve helped train special forces so it does not impress me when I hear overzealous young activists treat them like the enemy.  My brother Ken (extremophilechoice.com) and I have been working on a documentary about indigenous civil rights in the 21st century here in Canada. On March 11, I began my current trip hitch hiking west, and spent 2 weeks in Thunder Bay interviewing various people regarding - ‘the effects of white priviledge on all our lives’, and ‘what would indigenous culture suggest as a possible solution for climate change’.I then hitched two rides to Winnipeg, and eventually took a ViaRail to Vancouver in hopes of taking action against KM Canada before I was supposed to pay a $2000 fine on the 15th of April. The Alberta election dominated the media over that period so I’ve been keeping a low profile, training and preparing for today, April 29th.Now that I’m finally on target I’m asking for your help in paying off my expenses. As of today I’ve made four round trips from Ontario to British Columbia for court and research. I have a semi pro bono lawyer who was an activist in her youth and believes in what we are doing. This time I’ll be pleading not guilty so by the time I get out of jail and fly home I’ll have spent $20,000 on my cards in the last 14 months.This is a citizens action, me, a senior citizen. However, as always I encourage you to support organizations like STAND.earth, Greenpeace Canada and the Suzuki Foundation. Time’s ticking and all these people are working hard for our children and their children’s future. Thanks for your support.Cheers. t","April 29, 2019","$5,650","$5,000 "
Kira Galipeau ,"Etobicoke, ON","Sports, Teams & Clubs","Hello Everyone! I wanted to start this off by saying thanks for taking time out of your day to read this! It’s  kind of a long story, approximately 6 years long. But I promise I will shorten it as much as I possibly can. You might want to get comfortable though.I’m going to jump right into it and introduce the star of the show, my little brother, also known as Erik Galipeau. Erik is your average 18 year old boy... Except he lawn bowls. Yes... lawn bowls!! That was my first reaction as well.This story began when Erik was 12 years old. He saw an ad in a newspaper for a lawn bowling club that was looking for new junior members. I was surprised enough over a 12 year old reading a newspaper, let alone the fact that he really wanted to try lawn bowling. So, off my Dad and him went. Little did we know that was the first day of Erik’s lawn bowling adventure. For me to say he loved it was an understatement. He joined the club immediately, and despite being 50 years under the average demographic, he belonged there and was welcomed with open arms. Skipping ahead to August of 2014, Erik’s first tournament. He won 1 out of 11 games. Now... I know that doesn’t sound great but he won 1 game! His first tournament ever and he won a game! This was the first of many, many tournaments. Like I’m talking hundreds.                                Erik at his first tournamentIt seemed like he was living on the greens. Practices and games and tournaments ...his life revolved around lawn bowling. There is a remarkable lack of indoor lawn bowling spaces in Ontario so in the winter he had to work with what he could get. It got to the point where he was practicing in his coach’s office on industrial carpet. He even transformed my parent’s hallway into a green by placing a carpet runner over the hardwood floors and putting pillows lining the walls so he can practice right from home. In my opinion, he should be winning an award for over the top dedication.Slowly but surely losses became wins and wins became championship and we started realizing this kid was going places. Fast forward to December of 2016, now let me remind you Erik is 15 years old at this point. Erik was going to Glasgow, Scotland for a world championship tournament. I'm not going to lie I was a little jealous. But regardless of my jealousy he shocked absolutely everybody, including me, when he won gold at the U25 World Indoor Bowls Council (WIBC) World Indoor Triples with his 2 partners (Dominic McVittie from England and Rebecca Houston from Scotland) Not only did that make him the first overseas winner of a WIBC gold medal but also the youngest male to win a U25 WIBC gold medal. You should see the trophy, it’s beautiful.                 Erik in Glasgow, Scotland at the WIBC World Indoor Triples                 Erik with his WIBC trophiesHere is a list of some of his major accomplishments: 2016 Ontario Junior Bowler of the Year7 Ontario Lawn Bowling Association District Championships3 Ontario provincial championships (Indoor singles, U18 2018 and U18 2019)Bowls Canada 2018 National Junior ChampionshipPBA Canada Pairs Championship (Twice 2017 and 2018) – this has allowed him to participate in the World Bowls Tour Indoor World Championships at Potters Resort in EnglandPBA U25 Canadian Singles Championship (Twice 2016 and 2017) – this allowed him to participate in the WIBC U25 World Indoor Championships in Glasgow Scotland and Norwich WalesIn November of 2018, Erik was chosen to be a member of the Canadian Men’s National Team at 17 years old                   Team CanadaI feel like we can all agree, Erik is damn good lawn bowler and he has had quite the journey so far! So now I will explain why I’m telling you all of this. Erik’s journey is about to take a leap to the next level. At one of Erik’s more recent tournaments he met two competitors named Kyle McIlroy and Dave Rankin, from Australia. They have invited Erik to play Pennant Bowls at the Doubleview Bowls Club in Perth, Australia starting the fall of 2019. Erik will practice with and compete against some of the best in the world. This will give him a chance to showcase his talent on a huge stage. This opportunity is a major step towards Erik reaching his goals; winning a gold medal for Canada at the commonwealth games,  returning home where he hopes to grow and develop the sport in Canada, and being part of opening a world class indoor facility in Southern Ontario.I am hoping we can raise $5000.00 to help him make the most of this opportunity to play pennant bowls in Australia. This money will go a long way towards helping him cover the expenses associated with travelling to Australia, training down under, and being a member on the Canadian National Team. So there it is. My little brother, the lawn bowler. Also, one of the most talented, hardworking and dedicated kids I have ever met. Nothing will make me sadder than watching him get on a plane to the other side of the world, but at the same time, nothing will make me happier than to watch him chase his dream, even if his dream is on the other end of a flight to Australia. So please help us get Erik Galipeau out of the country.Finally, I want to thank everyone for their support and generosity. As a good friend of our family once said, “I just want to be a part of this kids journey” You can be too by following Erik on this on his Instagram page @erikgalipeaubowls. Also, stay tuned for my next go fund me titled “Fly Erik’s Sister to Australia to Visit”.(Eric Galipeau)","July 4, 2019","$2,440","$5,000 "

Due to our frail income, young ages, and expensive cross-border relationship (I'm American, she's Canadian), we married quickly at the Chapel Of Crystals in Las Vegas.

She's my light, my life, my wife.However, due to bad luck upon bad luck, we still cannot command the income we are worth. I've worked many dead-ends jobs, even been not paid by my so-called ""employers"" illegally. After all, I don't have the money to afford lawyer fees. Right now, I am working as a housekeeper and handyman, even though I have management experience. My employer won't pay me more due to his business slowly failing. He pays me $200/week for doing two jobs. $200/week is barely groceries. We're stuck. I've applied everywhere but received no replies. I'm hard-working with no criminal background, but like I said, bad luck seems to follow us wherever we go. We've been homeless twice in the past two years, lost our good car in a major wreck injuring us both, been financially scammed, lived through 4 cities (still counting), driven across the entire American East Coast in a beater car (twice), applied in every town, village, and city on our way, but alas, no replies! Just silence. Please send some luck our way! We can't wrap our heads around it either.All I want is my wife Grace, and for us to stop this incessant limbo between the USA and Canada. We both come from low-income families and they cannot help us anymore than they already have. Please, help us be together. Help me stay with my wife. We want to settle in Florida, where I live, somewhere in the countryside. I will work as many hours as I need, anywhere at all, in order to be with her.With these funds, we will apply for Grace's spousal visa, cover her travel costs, and we'd also love the opportunity to build a minimalist tiny house on some cheap land (or buy an RV to live in), foster crops for our family using sustainable organic practices, and if life allows, maybe even own a dog. It's a simple dream, can you help us today? Maybe spare this morning's cup of coffee?Thank you so much for your consideration. I can add more photos and details, if any interest arises. Please enjoy your day.All the best, Johnny & Grace","September 18, 2019",0,"$15,000 goal"

Sylvie Levert ,"Azilda, ON","Medical, Illness & Healing","#FIGHT4KERRYKerry is a vibrant, loving 39 year old mother, wife, sister, aunt, daughter and my best friend that is battling breast cancer for a 4th time!  She has spent the better part of her life as a mom - as a cancer patient.Help me help Kerry get the best possible treatment so she can finally beat this awful disease so she can raise her son and see him become a compassionate and loving young man.HISTORY:Kerry grew up in a small northern town of Sudbury, Ontario where she met the love of her life, bought a house and lived the fairy tale life that every little girl dreams about.  This fairy tale also included having the cutest baby boy Ryley in 2012.  That is where this fairy tale ends because Ryley has had to grow up watching his mom fight cancer since he has been two years old.  The word Cancer is a part of his speech that is normal for him but we all know that it shouldn't be part of anyone's vocabulary - especially at such a young age.  He has witnessed the effects of this horrendous disease all of his entire life and is still living thru the ups and downs of not knowing.  This beautiful family needs a chance to live a life free of worry from this despicable disease!  She was first diagnosed in 2014 at the young age of 35, with stage 1 Triple Negative breast cancer (TNBC). She underwent a lumpectomy, 6 cycles of chemo and 30 rounds of radiation. She did well until May 2016 when she got the bad news once again. So she received 6 more rounds of chemo followed by a bilateral mastectomy in Sept 2016. A PET scan was performed and the results came back negative for cancer, so no further treatments were needed at that point. She thought she had finally battled and beat cancer! Unfortunately in August 2017 she was given the bad news once again after a routine follow up appointment. She went onto 6 more months of chemo, more surgery and another 28 rounds of radiation.  A chest CT was performed and results showed no more signs of cancer.  Kerry beat it for a third time! On July 26, 2018 after a another routine CT chest scan & chest ultrasound she was diagnosed a 4th time. The left side came back positive for Metastatic ductal carcinoma.  TREATMENT:Even with being diagnosed four times, she is still positive and determined more than ever to BEAT this disease that has afflicted her for so long for the sake of loving life and her family more than ever.  GIVING UP IS NOT AN OPTION! Her treatment options at this time are as follows:  1)  her Canadian doctors are getting a second opinion from Toronto specialists to evaluate if surgery is an option at this point and to radiate, but fears it may not be promising given her history and pour results of all previous treatments.  A referral has also been sent to Princess Margaret in Toronto, Ontario to exhaust all possible treatments in Canada. 2)  Kerry has been exploring alternative cancer treatments not currently available in Canada, and has reached out to cancer clinics in Germany. These clinics offer specialized treatments such as regional chemotherapy (RCT). RCT has had good response rates for people in Kerry’s situation. However, pursuing this treatment is costly - approximately $200,000. She has a lot to think about and is considering all of the suggestions from her Canadian doctors, German hospitals and cancer clinics which offer the world's most advanced treatments.  Time is of the essence since it has already been 4 weeks since she has been diagnosed for the 4th time and no treatment plan has been set forth yet.  Regardless of where she decides to follow up with treatments, there are financial strains such as travelling and accommodations that will be incurred.There is HOPE!Several Canadians have explored the alternative cancer treatments and have had positive results.  Kerry has been in contact with a local survivor - a young woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer that had metastasized - that was in much of the same situation as she is currently in . This Canadian girl was told that she only had a few months to live. She decided to take fate into her own hands and went to Germany for RCT.  Her recent PET scan shows that there are no further signs of cancer.  And Sudbury also has a Chelmsford man attending the Germany clinic in September 2018 with positive anticipation of good news.  Please help Kerry finally beat this disease and get back to being a great mother, wife, sister, aunt, daughter and my best friend.  She needs your help to lessen the financial burdens that his awful disease has put on her and her family.   Please donate since time of the essence.Donate today!God bless you for all of your best wishes, prayers and generosity!","September 9, 2018","$159,922","$200,000 "

Lists on the wall of the many fire houses had Trucker working different assignments throughout New York city. Photos of the boards where shared on social media with the hashtag “TruckerRidesWithUs"". Fire fighters from around the world began to write “FF Dukes”, ”Dukes”, or “Trucker Dukes."" In his short three years of life, Trucker Dukes has touched the lives of so many world-wide.

Marissa Hayes ,"Balmoral, QLD","Sports, Teams & Clubs","Hi Football Family,It’s Marissa here. For those of you who don’t know, I have recently been selected to represent Australia in the FIRST EVER Women’s National Gridiron Team. It will be a privilege to create history and play such an integral part of growing the game in Australia, especially for women. In 2010, the International Federation of American Football (IFAF) held the first Women’s World Championship event in Stockholm, Sweden, with 6 countries competing. Hosted every 4 years, the 2017 IFAF Women’s World Cup will be held this June in Langley, Canada where Australia will field its first ever Women’s National Team in America Football. It is there that we will compete against 5 other countries – USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Mexico and Finland.During my short time within the sport, I have been fortunate enough to represent my state, competing for the Queensland Sundevils in the inaugural Women’s Australian Gridiron League competition in 2014. In 2016, I once again earned that honour, with the first game taking place in April. In addition to state selection, I was privileged enough in 2016 to be selected amongst the most talented women in Australia to fight for an international position at the Australian Outback Women’s Selection Camp for the 2017 IFAF World Cup Championships. I am sincerely humbled, to say the least, that I earned a spot on the 52-women roaster.Unfortunately, with women’s sport both underappreciated and unrecognised throughout Australia, as well as the little to no corporate sponsorship for individuals in our amateur sport, such an international event is completely self-funded by the athletes. Thus, the reality of a childhood dream of representing the green and gold is somewhat diminished with the thought of such a financial burden… that’s why I need YOUR help. For the price of a coffee (or a schooner!) you could make a big difference in helping make my dream come true. Funds raised go towards all my team fees such as flights, accommodation, unifrom and administration fees.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and every donation made helps me get closer to the World Championships in Canada. So thank you to everyone who has supported me thus far on my journey and I hope to do you all proud!For partial or full sponsorship packages, please contact me via phone, email or the link below. Thank you once again in advance for your support & generosity, everything makes a difference.If YOU are considering DONATING please contact me BEFORE you process through the gofundme link as I have alternative payment arrangements!Follow my journey on: FB: https://www.facebook.com/Marissa-Hayes-13-926971744068662/ Instagram: @storme1Cheers,Riss #13","March 1, 2017","$5,000","$8,000 "
Elizabeth Calvin ,"Uxbridge, ON",Non-Profits & Charities," A unique concentration of public lands and walking trails lies north east of Toronto. These trails, which travel through forests and across gurgling streams, stretch across the gentle rolling hills in the southern part of Uxbridge Township and northwards into the town of Uxbridge, “Trail Capital of Canada”. Soon this trail network will connect with the new Rouge National Urban Park and will also be accessible by public transit. Already many walkers, hikers, cross-country skiers and snowshoers travel from far and wide to enjoy this natural area. But information about the trails – how to get to them and how to avoid getting lost – is not easy to come by. Several different organizations manage the lands and trails, each with separate and incomplete map systems of varying quality. For some areas, maps do not even exist. Green Durham Association, a not-for-profit charitable organization dedicated to protecting, preserving and enhancing the forests, farmlands and natural areas in this region, plans to develop a set of comprehensive trail maps to help people find their way to these beautiful trails. GDA has commissioned a local recreational map-making company to create high quality waterproof maps which will provide detailed “in the field” trail guides for users. Our goal is to highlight the trail system and provide essential information to assist to help new users feel confident about exploring this beautiful area. The maps will be developed in stages; we hope to reach our fundraising goal by Canadian Thanksgiving, 2016 to fund the first set of maps.  Sales of the maps will help generate funds to continue this project. Maps will be sold at local businesses and at regional and national outdoor stores. Please donate and help us make this ambitious project a reality! GDA can issue you a receipt for charitable donations over $20. For more information about the map project and about GDA please visit the Green Durham website.","July 2, 2016","$2,260","$20,000 "
